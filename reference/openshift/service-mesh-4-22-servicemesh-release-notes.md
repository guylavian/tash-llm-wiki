= Introduction to {SMProductName}

{SMProductName} addresses a variety of problems in a microservice architecture by creating a centralized point of control in an application. It adds a transparent layer on existing distributed applications without requiring any changes to the application code.

Microservice architectures split the work of enterprise applications into modular services, which can make scaling and maintenance easier. However, as an enterprise application built on a microservice architecture grows in size and complexity, it becomes difficult to understand and manage. {SMProductShortName} can address those architecture problems by capturing or intercepting traffic between services and can modify, redirect, or create new requests to other services.

{SMProductShortName}, which is based on the open source Istio project, provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services that provides discovery, load balancing, service-to-service authentication, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring. A service mesh also provides more complex operational functionality, including A/B testing, canary releases, access control, and end-to-end authentication.

[NOTE]

{SMProductName} 3 is generally available. For more information, see {SMProductName} 3.0.

[id="about-must-gather_{context}"]
= About the must-gather tool

[role="_abstract"]
The `oc adm must-gather` CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues, including:

* Resource definitions
* Service logs

By default, the `oc adm must-gather` command uses the default plugin image and writes into `./must-gather.local`.

Alternatively, you can collect specific information by running the command with the appropriate arguments as described in the following sections:

* To collect data related to one or more specific features, use the `--image` argument with an image, as listed in a following section.
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v{HCOVersion}
----

* To collect the audit logs, use the `-- /usr/bin/gather_audit_logs` argument, as described in a following section.
+

For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather -- /usr/bin/gather_audit_logs
----
+
[NOTE]
====
- Audit logs are not collected as part of the default set of information to reduce the size of the files.
- On a Windows operating system, install the `cwRsync` client and add to the `PATH`  variable for use with the `oc rsync` command.
====

When you run `oc adm must-gather`, a new pod with a random name is created in a new project on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with `must-gather.local` in the current working directory.

For example:

[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE                      NAME                 READY   STATUS      RESTARTS      AGE

openshift-must-gather-5drcj    must-gather-s8sdh    2/2     Running     0             72s
...
----
// todo: table or ref module listing available images?
Optionally, you can run the `oc adm must-gather` command in a specific namespace by using the `--run-namespace` option.

For example:

[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --run-namespace <namespace> \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v{HCOVersion}
----

=== Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* The OpenShift Container Platform CLI (`oc`) installed.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//

= New Features

*Feature* – Describe the new functionality available to the customer. For enhancements, try to describe as specifically as possible where the customer will see changes.
*Reason* – If known, include why has the enhancement been implemented (use case, performance, technology, etc.). For example, showcases integration of X with Y, demonstrates Z API feature, includes latest framework bug fixes. There may not have been a 'problem' previously, but system behavior may have changed.
*Result* – If changed, describe the current user experience
{SMProductName} provides a number of key capabilities uniformly across a network of services:

* *Traffic Management* - Control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, make calls more reliable, and make the network more robust in the face of adverse conditions.
* *Service Identity and Security* - Provide services in the mesh with a verifiable identity and provide the ability to protect service traffic as it flows over networks of varying degrees of trustworthiness.
* *Policy Enforcement* - Apply organizational policy to the interaction between services, ensure access policies are enforced and resources are fairly distributed among consumers. Policy changes are made by configuring the mesh, not by changing application code.
* *Telemetry* - Gain understanding of the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them, providing the ability to quickly identify issues.

== New features {SMProductName} 1.1.17.1

This release of {SMProductName} addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

=== Change in how {SMProductName} handles URI fragments

{SMProductName} contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability, CVE-2021-39156, where an HTTP request with a fragment (a section in the end of a URI that begins with a # character) in the URI path could bypass the Istio URI path-based authorization policies. For instance, an Istio authorization policy denies requests sent to the URI path `/user/profile`. In the vulnerable versions, a request with URI path `/user/profile#section1` bypasses the deny policy and routes to the backend (with the normalized URI `path /user/profile%23section1`), possibly leading to a security incident.

You are impacted by this vulnerability if you use authorization policies with DENY actions and `operation.paths`, or ALLOW actions and `operation.notPaths`.

With the mitigation, the fragment part of the request’s URI is removed before the authorization and routing. This prevents a request with a fragment in its URI from bypassing authorization policies which are based on the URI without the fragment part.

=== Required update for authorization policies

Istio generates hostnames for both the hostname itself and all matching ports. For instance, a virtual service or Gateway for a host of "httpbin.foo" generates a config matching "httpbin.foo and httpbin.foo:*". However, exact match authorization policies only match the exact string given for the `hosts` or `notHosts` fields.

Your cluster is impacted if you have `AuthorizationPolicy` resources using exact string comparison for the rule to determine hosts or notHosts.

You must update your authorization policy rules to use prefix match instead of exact match.  For example, replacing `hosts: ["httpbin.com"]` with `hosts: ["httpbin.com:*"]` in the first `AuthorizationPolicy` example.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are manual steps that must be completed to address CVE-2021-29492 and CVE-2021-31920.
====

[id="manual-updates-cve-2021-29492_{context}"]
=== Manual updates required by CVE-2021-29492 and CVE-2021-31920

Istio contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request path with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters (`%2F` or `%5C`) could potentially bypass an Istio authorization policy when path-based authorization rules are used.

For example, assume an Istio cluster administrator defines an authorization DENY policy to reject the request at path `/admin`. A request sent to the URL path `//admin` will NOT be rejected by the authorization policy.

According to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6[RFC 3986], the path `//admin` with multiple slashes should technically be treated as a different path from the `/admin`. However, some backend services choose to normalize the URL paths by merging multiple slashes into a single slash. This can result in a bypass of the authorization policy (`//admin` does not match `/admin`), and a user can access the resource at path `/admin` in the backend; this would represent a security incident.

Your cluster is impacted by this vulnerability if you have authorization policies using `ALLOW action + notPaths` field or `DENY action + paths field` patterns. These patterns are vulnerable to unexpected policy bypasses.

Your cluster is NOT impacted by this vulnerability if:

* You don’t have authorization policies.
* Your authorization policies don’t define `paths` or `notPaths` fields.
* Your authorization policies use `ALLOW action + paths` field or `DENY action + notPaths` field patterns. These patterns could only cause unexpected rejection instead of policy bypasses. The upgrade is optional for these cases.

[NOTE]
====
The {SMProductName} configuration location for path normalization is different from the Istio configuration.
====

=== Updating the path normalization configuration

Istio authorization policies can be based on the URL paths in the HTTP request.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_normalization[Path normalization], also known as URI normalization, modifies and standardizes the incoming requests' paths so that the normalized paths can be processed in a standard way.
Syntactically different paths may be equivalent after path normalization.

Istio supports the following normalization schemes on the request paths before evaluating against the authorization policies and routing the requests:

.Normalization schemes
[options="header"]
[cols="a, a, a, a"]
|====
| Option | Description | Example |Notes
|`NONE`
|No normalization is done. Anything received by Envoy will be forwarded exactly as-is to any backend service.
|`../%2Fa../b` is evaluated by the authorization policies and sent to your service.
|This setting is vulnerable to CVE-2021-31920.

|`BASE`
|This is currently the option used in the *default* installation of Istio. This applies the https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-filters-network-http-connection-manager-v3-httpconnectionmanager-normalize-path[`normalize_path`] option on Envoy proxies, which follows https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986] with extra normalization to convert backslashes to forward slashes.
|`/a/../b` is normalized to `/b`. `\da` is normalized to `/da`.
|This setting is vulnerable to CVE-2021-31920.

| `MERGE_SLASHES`
| Slashes are merged after the _BASE_ normalization.
| `/a//b` is normalized to `/a/b`.
|Update to this setting to mitigate CVE-2021-31920.

|`DECODE_AND_MERGE_SLASHES`
|The strictest setting when you allow all traffic by default. This setting is recommended, with the caveat that you must thoroughly test your authorization policies routes. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1[Percent-encoded] slash and backslash characters (`%2F`, `%2f`, `%5C` and `%5c`) are decoded to `/` or `\`, before the `MERGE_SLASHES` normalization.
|`/a%2fb` is normalized to `/a/b`.
|Update to this setting to mitigate CVE-2021-31920.  This setting is more secure, but also has the potential to break applications.  Test your applications before deploying to production.
|====

The normalization algorithms are conducted in the following order:

. Percent-decode `%2F`, `%2f`, `%5C` and `%5c`.
. The https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986] and other normalization implemented by the https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-filters-network-http-connection-manager-v3-httpconnectionmanager-normalize-path[`normalize_path`] option in Envoy.
. Merge slashes.

[WARNING]
====
While these normalization options represent recommendations from HTTP standards and common industry practices, applications may interpret a URL in any way it chooses to. When using denial policies, ensure that you understand how your application behaves.
====

=== Path normalization configuration examples

Ensuring Envoy normalizes request paths to match your backend services' expectations is critical to the security of your system.
The following examples can be used as a reference for you to configure your system.
The normalized URL paths, or the original URL paths if `NONE` is selected, will be:

. Used to check against the authorization policies.
. Forwarded to the backend application.

.Configuration examples
[options="header"]
[cols="a, a"]
|====
|If your application... |Choose...
|Relies on the proxy to do normalization
|`BASE`, `MERGE_SLASHES` or `DECODE_AND_MERGE_SLASHES`

|Normalizes request paths based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986] and does not merge slashes.
|`BASE`

|Normalizes request paths based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986] and merges slashes, but does not decode https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1[percent-encoded] slashes.
|`MERGE_SLASHES`

|Normalizes request paths based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986], decodes https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1[percent-encoded] slashes, and merges slashes.
|`DECODE_AND_MERGE_SLASHES`

|Processes request paths in a way that is incompatible with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986].
|`NONE`

=== Manual updates required by CVE-2020-8663

The fix for CVE-2020-8663`: envoy: Resource exhaustion when accepting too many connections` added a configurable limit on downstream connections. The configuration option for this limit must be configured to mitigate this vulnerability.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These manual steps are required to mitigate this CVE whether you are using the 1.1 version or the 1.0 version of {SMProductName}.
====

This new configuration option is called `overload.global_downstream_max_connections`, and it is configurable as a proxy `runtime` setting.  Perform the following steps to configure limits at the Ingress Gateway.

.Procedure

. Create a file named `bootstrap-override.json` with the following text to force the proxy to override the bootstrap template and load runtime configuration from disk:
+
  {
    "runtime": {
      "symlink_root": "/var/lib/istio/envoy/runtime"
    }
  }
+
. Create a secret from the `bootstrap-override.json` file, replacing <SMCPnamespace> with the namespace where you created the service mesh control plane (SMCP):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc create secret generic -n <SMCPnamespace> gateway-bootstrap --from-file=bootstrap-override.json
----
+
. Update the SMCP configuration to activate the override.

+

        - mountPath: /var/lib/istio/envoy/custom-bootstrap
          name: custom-bootstrap
          secretName: gateway-bootstrap
----
+

. To set the new configuration option, create a secret that has the desired value for the `overload.global_downstream_max_connections` setting.  The following example uses a value of `10000`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc create secret generic -n <SMCPnamespace> gateway-settings --from-literal=overload.global_downstream_max_connections=10000
----

. Update the SMCP again to mount the secret in the location where Envoy is looking for runtime configuration:

[id="upgrading_es5_es6_{context}"]
=== Upgrading from Elasticsearch 5 to Elasticsearch 6

When updating from Elasticsearch 5 to Elasticsearch 6, you must delete your Jaeger instance, then recreate the Jaeger instance because of an issue with certificates. Re-creating the Jaeger instance triggers creating a new set of certificates.   If you are using persistent storage the same volumes can be mounted for the new Jaeger instance as long as the Jaeger name and namespace for the new Jaeger instance are the same as the deleted Jaeger instance.

.Procedure if Jaeger is installed as part of Red Hat Service Mesh

. Determine the name of your Jaeger custom resource file:

[id="ossm-manual-updates-1.0-1.1_{context}"]
=== Manual updates from 1.0 to 1.1

If you are updating from {SMProductName} 1.0 to 1.1, you must update the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to update the control plane components to the new version.

. In the web console, click the {SMProductName} Operator.

. Click the *Project* menu and choose the project where your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` is deployed from the list, for example `istio-system`.

. Click the name of your control plane, for example `basic-install`.

. Click YAML and add a version field to the `spec:` of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. For example, to update to {SMProductName} 1.1.0, add `version: v1.1`.

----
spec:
  version: v1.1
  ...
----

The version field specifies the version of {SMProductShortName} to install and defaults to the latest available version.

[NOTE]
====
Note that support for {SMProductName} v1.0 ended in October, 2020.  You must upgrade to either v1.1 or v2.0.

[id="ossm-deprecated-features-1x_{context}"]
Description - Description of the any features (including technology previews) that have been removed from the product.  Write the description from a customer perspective, what UI elements, commands, or options are no longer available.
Consequence or a recommended replacement - Description of what the customer can no longer do, and recommended replacement (if known).
= Deprecated features
Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed.

Deprecated functionality is still included in OpenShift Container Platform and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

== Deprecated features {SMProductName} 1.1.5

The following custom resources were deprecated in release 1.1.5 and were removed in release 1.1.12

* `Policy` - The `Policy` resource is deprecated and will be replaced by the `PeerAuthentication` resource in a future release.
* `MeshPolicy` - The `MeshPolicy` resource is deprecated and will be replaced by the `PeerAuthentication` resource in a future release.
* `v1alpha1` RBAC API -The v1alpha1 RBAC policy is deprecated by the v1beta1 `AuthorizationPolicy`. RBAC (Role Based Access Control) defines `ServiceRole` and `ServiceRoleBinding` objects.
** `ServiceRole`
** `ServiceRoleBinding`
* `RbacConfig` - `RbacConfig` implements the Custom Resource Definition for controlling Istio RBAC behavior.
** `ClusterRbacConfig`(versions prior to {SMProductName} 1.0)
** `ServiceMeshRbacConfig` ({SMProductName} version 1.0 and later)
* In Kiali, the `login` and `LDAP` strategies are deprecated. A future version will introduce authentication using OpenID providers.

The following components are also deprecated in this release and will be replaced by the *Istiod* component in a future release.

* *Mixer* - access control and usage policies
* *Pilot* - service discovery and proxy configuration
* *Citadel* - certificate generation
* *Galley* - configuration validation and distribution

* service_mesh/v1x/servicemesh-release-notes.adoc

[id="ossm-rn-known-issues-1x_{context}"]
= Known issues

*Consequence* - What user action or situation would make this problem appear (Selecting the Foo option with the Bar version 1.3 plugin enabled results in an error message)?  What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
*Cause* (if it has been identified) - Why did this happen?
*Workaround* (If there is one)- What can you do to avoid or negate the effects of this issue in the meantime?  Sometimes if there is no workaround it is worthwhile telling readers to contact support for advice. Never promise future fixes.
*Result* - If the workaround does not completely address the problem.

These limitations exist in {SMProductName}:

* {SMProductName} does not support IPv6, as it is not supported by the upstream Istio project, nor fully supported by OpenShift Container Platform.

* Graph layout - The layout for the Kiali graph can render differently, depending on your application architecture and the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions). Because it is difficult if not impossible to create a single layout that renders nicely for every situation, Kiali offers a choice of several different layouts. To choose a different layout, you can choose a different *Layout Schema* from the *Graph Settings* menu.

* The first time you access related services such as Jaeger and Grafana, from the Kiali console, you must accept the certificate and re-authenticate using your OpenShift Container Platform login credentials. This happens due to an issue with how the framework displays embedded pages in the console.

[id="ossm-rn-known-issues-ossm_{context}"]
== {SMProductShortName} known issues

These are the known issues in {SMProductName}:

* Jaeger/Kiali Operator upgrade blocked with operator pending When upgrading the Jaeger or Kiali Operators with Service Mesh 1.0.x installed, the operator status shows as Pending.
+
Workaround: See the linked Knowledge Base article for more information.

* Istio-14743 Due to limitations in the version of Istio that this release of {SMProductName} is based on, there are several applications that are currently incompatible with {SMProductShortName}. See the linked community issue for details.

* MAISTRA-858 The following Envoy log messages describing deprecated options and configurations associated with Istio 1.1.x are expected:
+
** [2019-06-03 07:03:28.943][19][warning][misc] [external/envoy/source/common/protobuf/utility.cc:129] Using deprecated option 'envoy.api.v2.listener.Filter.config'. This configuration will be removed from Envoy soon.
** [2019-08-12 22:12:59.001][13][warning][misc] [external/envoy/source/common/protobuf/utility.cc:174] Using deprecated option 'envoy.api.v2.Listener.use_original_dst' from file lds.proto. This configuration will be removed from Envoy soon.

* MAISTRA-806 Evicted Istio Operator Pod causes mesh and CNI not to deploy.
+
Workaround: If the `istio-operator` pod is evicted while deploying the control pane, delete the evicted `istio-operator` pod.
+
* MAISTRA-681 When the control plane has many namespaces, it can lead to performance issues.

* MAISTRA-465 The Maistra Operator fails to create a service for operator metrics.

* MAISTRA-453 If you create a new project and deploy pods immediately, sidecar injection does not occur. The operator fails to add the `maistra.io/member-of` before the pods are created, therefore the pods must be deleted and recreated for sidecar injection to occur.

* MAISTRA-158 Applying multiple gateways referencing the same hostname will cause all gateways to stop functioning.

[id="ossm-rn-known-issues-kiali_{context}"]
== Kiali known issues

[NOTE]
====
New issues for Kiali should be created in the OpenShift Service Mesh  project with the `Component` set to `Kiali`.
====

These are the known issues in Kiali:

* KIALI-2206 When you are accessing the Kiali console for the first time, and there is no cached browser data for Kiali, the “View in Grafana” link on the Metrics tab of the Kiali Service Details page redirects to the wrong location. The only way you would encounter this issue is if you are accessing Kiali for the first time.

* KIALI-507 Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11. This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer. To access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.

Module included in the following assemblies:
* service_mesh/v1x/servicemesh-release-notes.adoc

[id="ossm-rn-fixed-issues-1x_{context}"]
= Fixed issues

Provide the following info for each issue if possible:
*Consequence* - What user action or situation would make this problem appear (If you have the foo option enabled and did x)? What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
*Cause* - Why did this happen?
*Fix* - What did we change to fix the problem?
*Result* - How has the behavior changed as a result? Try to avoid “It is fixed” or “The issue is resolved” or “The error no longer presents”.

The following issues been resolved in the current release:

[id="ossm-rn-fixed-issues-ossm_{context}"]
== {SMProductShortName} fixed issues

* MAISTRA-2371 Handle tombstones in listerInformer. The updated cache codebase was not handling tombstones when translating the events from the namespace caches to the aggregated cache, leading to a panic in the go routine.

* OSSM-542 Galley is not using the new certificate after rotation.

* OSSM-99 Workloads generated from direct pod without labels may crash Kiali.

* OSSM-93 IstioConfigList can't filter by two or more names.

* OSSM-92 Cancelling unsaved changes on the VS/DR YAML edit page does not cancel the changes.

* OSSM-90 Traces not available on the service details page.

[id="ossm-rn-fixed-issues-maistra_{context}"]
* MAISTRA-1649 Headless services conflict when in different namespaces. When deploying headless services within different namespaces the endpoint configuration is merged and results in invalid Envoy configurations being pushed to the sidecars.

* MAISTRA-1541 Panic in kubernetesenv when the controller is not set on owner reference. If a pod has an ownerReference which does not specify the controller, this will cause a panic within the `kubernetesenv cache.go` code.

* MAISTRA-1352 Cert-manager Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) from the control plane installation have been removed for this release and future releases. If you have already installed {SMProductName}, the CRDs must be removed manually if cert-manager is not being used.

* MAISTRA-1001 Closing HTTP/2 connections could lead to segmentation faults in `istio-proxy`.

* MAISTRA-932 Added the `requires` metadata to add dependency relationship between Jaeger Operator and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. Ensures that when the Jaeger Operator is installed, it automatically deploys the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator if it is not available.

* MAISTRA-862 Galley dropped watches and stopped providing configuration to other components after many namespace deletions and re-creations.

* MAISTRA-833 Pilot stopped delivering configuration after many namespace deletions and re-creations.

* MAISTRA-684 The default Jaeger version in the `istio-operator` is 1.12.0, which does not match Jaeger version 1.13.1 that shipped in {SMProductName} 0.12.TechPreview.

* MAISTRA-622 In Maistra 0.12.0/TP12, permissive mode does not work. The user has the option to use Plain text mode or Mutual TLS mode, but not permissive.

* MAISTRA-572 Jaeger cannot be used with Kiali. In this release Jaeger is configured to use the OAuth proxy, but is also only configured to work through a browser and does not allow service access. Kiali cannot properly communicate with the Jaeger endpoint and it considers Jaeger to be disabled. See also TRACING-591.

* MAISTRA-357 In OpenShift 4 Beta on AWS, it is not possible, by default, to access a TCP or HTTPS service through the ingress gateway on a port other than port 80. The AWS load balancer has a health check that verifies if port 80 on the service endpoint is active. Without a service running on port 80, the load balancer health check fails.

* MAISTRA-348 OpenShift 4 Beta on AWS does not support ingress gateway traffic on ports other than 80 or 443.  If you configure your ingress gateway to handle TCP traffic with a port number other than 80 or 443, you have to use the service hostname provided by the AWS load balancer rather than the OpenShift router as a workaround.

* MAISTRA-193 Unexpected console info messages are visible when health checking is enabled for citadel.

* Bug 1821432 Toggle controls in OpenShift Container Platform Control Resource details page do not update the CR correctly. UI Toggle controls in the Service Mesh Control Plane (SMCP) Overview page in the OpenShift Container Platform web console sometimes update the wrong field in the resource. To update a ServiceMeshControlPlane resource, edit the YAML content directly or update the resource from the command line instead of clicking the toggle controls.

[id="ossm-rn-fixed-issues-kiali_{context}"]
== Kiali fixed issues

* KIALI-3239 If a Kiali Operator pod has failed with a status of “Evicted” it blocks the Kiali operator from deploying. The workaround is to delete the Evicted pod and redeploy the Kiali operator.

* KIALI-3118 After changes to the ServiceMeshMemberRoll, for example adding or removing projects, the Kiali pod restarts and then displays errors on the Graph page while the Kiali pod is restarting.

* KIALI-3096 Runtime metrics fail in {SMProductShortName}. There is an OAuth filter between the {SMProductShortName} and Prometheus, requiring a bearer token to be passed to Prometheus before access is granted. Kiali has been updated to use this token when communicating to the Prometheus server, but the application metrics are currently failing with 403 errors.

* KIALI-3070 This bug only affects custom dashboards, not the default dashboards. When you select labels in metrics settings and refresh the page, your selections are retained in the menu but your selections are not displayed on the charts.

* KIALI-2686 When the control plane has many namespaces, it can lead to performance issues.
