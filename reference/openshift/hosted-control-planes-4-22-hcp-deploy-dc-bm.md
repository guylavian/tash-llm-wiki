# Deploying {hcp} on bare metal in a disconnected environment

[id="hcp-deploy-dc-bm"]
= Deploying {hcp} on bare metal in a disconnected environment

When you provision {hcp} on bare metal, you use the Agent platform. The Agent platform and {mce} work together to enable disconnected deployments. The Agent platform uses the central infrastructure management service to add worker nodes to a hosted cluster. For an introduction to the central infrastructure management service, see Enabling the central infrastructure management service.

// Module included in the following assemblies:

= Disconnected environment architecture for bare metal

The following diagram illustrates an example architecture of a disconnected environment:

image:../images/489_RHACM_HyperShift_on_bare_metal_1223.png[Disconnected architecture diagram]

. Configure infrastructure services, including the registry certificate deployment with TLS support, web server, and DNS, to ensure that the disconnected deployment works.
. Create a config map in the `openshift-config` namespace. In this example, the config map is named `registry-config`. The content of the config map is the Registry CA certificate. The data field of the config map must contain the following key/value:

* Key: `<registry_dns_domain_name>..<port>`, for example, `registry.hypershiftdomain.lab..5000:`. Ensure that you place `..` after the registry DNS domain name when you specify a port.
* Value: The certificate content
+
For more information about creating a config map, see _Configuring TLS certificates for a disconnected installation of {hcp}_.
. Modify the `images.config.openshift.io` custom resource (CR) specification and adds a new field named `additionalTrustedCA` with a value of `name: registry-config`.
. Create a config map that contains two data fields. One field contains the `registries.conf` file in `RAW` format, and the other field contains the Registry CA and is named `ca-bundle.crt`. The config map belongs to the `multicluster-engine` namespace, and the config map name is referenced in other objects. For an example of a config map, see the following sample configuration:
+

    mirror-by-digest-only = true
# ...
# ...
----

. In the {mce-short} namespace, you create the `multiclusterengine` CR, which enables both the Agent and `hypershift-addon` add-ons. The {mce-short} namespace must contain the config maps to modify behavior in a disconnected deployment. The namespace also contains the `multicluster-engine`, `assisted-service`, and `hypershift-addon-manager` pods.
. Create the following objects that are necessary to deploy the hosted cluster:

** Secrets: Secrets contain the pull secret, SSH key, and etcd encryption key.
** Config map: The config map contains the CA certificate of the private registry.
** `HostedCluster`: The `HostedCluster` resource defines the configuration of the cluster that the user intends to create.
** `NodePool`: The `NodePool` resource identifies the node pool that references the machines to use for the data plane.

. After you create the hosted cluster objects, the HyperShift Operator establishes the `HostedControlPlane` namespace to accommodate control plane pods. The namespace also hosts components such as Agents, bare metal hosts (BMHs), and the `InfraEnv` resource. Later, you create the `InfraEnv` resource, and after ISO creation, you create the BMHs and their secrets that contain baseboard management controller (BMC) credentials.

. The Metal3 Operator in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace inspects the new BMHs. Then, the Metal3 Operator tries to connect to the BMCs to start them by using the configured `LiveISO` and `RootFS` values that are specified through the `AgentServiceConfig` CR in the {mce-short} namespace.

. After the worker nodes of the `HostedCluster` resource are started, an Agent container is started. This agent establishes contact with the Assisted Service, which orchestrates the actions to complete the deployment. Initially, you need to scale the `NodePool` resource to the number of worker nodes for the `HostedCluster` resource. The Assisted Service manages the remaining tasks.

. At this point, you wait for the deployment process to be completed.

= Requirements to deploy {hcp} on bare metal in a disconnected environment

To configure {hcp} in a disconnected environment, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- CPU: The number of CPUs provided determines how many hosted clusters can run concurrently. In general, use 16 CPUs for each node for 3 nodes. For minimal development, you can use 12 CPUs for each node for 3 nodes.
- Memory: The amount of RAM affects how many hosted clusters can be hosted. Use 48 GB of RAM for each node. For minimal development, 18 GB of RAM might be sufficient.
- Storage: Use SSD storage for {mce-short}.
* Management cluster: 250 GB.
* Registry: The storage needed depends on the number of releases, operators, and images that are hosted. An acceptable number might be 500 GB, preferably separated from the disk that hosts the hosted cluster.
* Web server: The storage needed depends on the number of ISOs and images that are hosted. An acceptable number might be 500 GB.
- Production: For a production environment, separate the management cluster, the registry, and the web server on different disks. This example illustrates a possible configuration for production:
* Registry: 2 TB
* Management cluster: 500 GB
* Web server: 2 TB

= Extracting the release image digest

You can extract the OpenShift Container Platform release image digest by using the tagged image.

.Procedure

* Obtain the image digest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info <tagged_openshift_release_image> | grep "Pull From"
----
+
Replace `<tagged_openshift_release_image>` with the tagged image for the supported OpenShift Container Platform version, for example, `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.14.0-x8_64`.
+
.Example output

[id="hcp-bm-dns_{context}"]
= DNS configurations on bare metal

[role="_abstract"]
The API Server for the hosted cluster is exposed as a `NodePort` service. A DNS entry must exist for `api.<hosted_cluster_name>.<base_domain>` that points to destination where the API Server can be reached.

The DNS entry can be as simple as a record that points to one of the nodes in the management cluster that is running the hosted control plane. The entry can also point to a load balancer that is deployed to redirect incoming traffic to the ingress pods.

.Example DNS configuration
[source,terminal]
----
api.example.krnl.es.    IN A 192.168.122.20

`*`.apps.example.krnl.es. IN A 192.168.122.23
----

[NOTE]
====
In the previous example, `*.apps.example.krnl.es. IN A 192.168.122.23` is either a node in the hosted cluster or a load balancer, if one has been configured.

[id="hcp-dc-mgmt-cluster_{context}"]
= Setting up a management cluster for {hcp} in a disconnected environment

To set up an OpenShift Container Platform management cluster, you need to ensure that the {mce} is installed. The {mce-short} plays a crucial role in deploying clusters across providers.

.Prerequisites

* There must be bidirectional connectivity between the management cluster and the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) of the target Bare Metal Host (BMH). As an alternative, you follow a Boot It Yourself approach through the Agent provider.

* The hosted cluster must be able to resolve and reach the API hostname of the management cluster hostname and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname. Here is an example of the API hostname of the management cluster and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname:

** `api.management-cluster.internal.domain.com`
** `console-openshift-console.apps.management-cluster.internal.domain.com`

* The management cluster must be able to resolve and reach the API and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname of the hosted cluster. Here is an example of the API hostname of the hosted cluster and `{asterisk}.apps` hostname:

** `api.sno-hosted-cluster-1.internal.domain.com`
** `console-openshift-console.apps.sno-hosted-cluster-1.internal.domain.com`

.Procedure

. Install {mce-short} 2.4 or later on an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. You can install {mce-short} as an Operator from the OpenShift Container Platform software catalog. The HyperShift Operator is included with {mce-short}. For more information about installing {mce-short}, see "Installing and upgrading multicluster engine operator" in the Red{nbsp}Hat Advanced Cluster Management documentation.

. Ensure that the HyperShift Operator is installed. The HyperShift Operator is automatically included with {mce-short}, but if you need to manually install it, follow the steps in "Manually enabling the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on for local-cluster".

.Next steps

Next, configure the web server.

[id="hcp-dc-web-server_{context}"]
= Configuring the web server for {hcp} in a disconnected environment

You need to configure an additional web server to host the {op-system-first} images that are associated with the OpenShift Container Platform release that you are deploying as a hosted cluster.

.Procedure

To configure the web server, complete the following steps:

. Extract the `openshift-install` binary from the OpenShift Container Platform release that you want to use by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} release extract --command=openshift-install \
  "${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE}"
----

. Run the following script. The script creates a folder in the `/opt/srv` directory. The folder contains the {op-system} images to provision the worker nodes.
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

WEBSRV_FOLDER=/opt/srv

[id="hcp-dc-image-mirror_{context}"]
= Configuring image mirroring for {hcp} in a disconnected environment

Image mirroring is the process of fetching images from external registries, such as `registry.redhat.com` or `quay.io`, and storing them in your private registry.

In the following procedures, the `oc-mirror` tool is used, which is a binary that uses the `ImageSetConfiguration` object. In the file, you can specify the following information:

* The OpenShift Container Platform versions to mirror. The versions are in `quay.io`.
* The additional Operators to mirror. Select packages individually.
* The extra images that you want to add to the repository.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that the registry server is running before you start the mirroring process.

.Procedure

To configure image mirroring, complete the following steps:

. Ensure that your `${HOME}/.docker/config.json` file is updated with the registries that you are going to mirror from and with the private registry that you plan to push the images to.

. By using the following example, create an `ImageSetConfiguration` object to use for mirroring. Replace values as needed to match your environment:

. Start the mirroring process by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----

+
After the mirroring process is finished, you have a new folder named `mirror-file`, which contains the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS), `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS), and the catalog sources to apply on the hosted cluster.

. Mirror the nightly or CI versions of OpenShift Container Platform by configuring the `imagesetconfig.yaml` file as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:

<2> Set this optional flag to `true` if you want to also mirror the container disk image for the {op-system-first} boot image for the KubeVirt provider. This flag is available with oc-mirror v2 only.

. If you have a partially disconnected environment, mirror the images from the image set configuration to a registry by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c imagesetconfig.yaml \
  --workspace file://<file_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --v2

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror -c imagesetconfig.yaml file://<file_path> --v2
----
+
For more information, see "Mirroring an image set in a fully disconnected environment".

[id="hcp-dc-apply-objects_{context}"]
= Applying objects in the management cluster

After the mirroring process is complete, you need to apply two objects in the management cluster:

* `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) or `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS)
* Catalog sources

When you use the `oc-mirror` tool, the output artifacts are in a folder named `oc-mirror-workspace/results-XXXXXX/`.

The ICSP or IDMS initiates a `MachineConfig` change that does not restart your nodes but restarts the kubelet on each of them. After the nodes are marked as `READY`, you need to apply the newly generated catalog sources.

The catalog sources initiate actions in the `openshift-marketplace` Operator, such as downloading the catalog image and processing it to retrieve all the `PackageManifests` that are included in that image.

.Procedure

. To check the new sources, run the following command by using the new `CatalogSource` as a source:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get packagemanifest
----

. To apply the artifacts, complete the following steps:

.. Create the ICSP or IDMS artifacts by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f oc-mirror-workspace/results-XXXXXX/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----

.. Wait for the nodes to become ready, and then enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f catalogSource-XXXXXXXX-index.yaml
----

. Mirror the OLM catalogs and configure the hosted cluster to point to the mirror.
+
When you use the `management` (default) OLMCatalogPlacement mode, the image stream that is used for OLM catalogs is not automatically amended with override information from the ICSP on the management cluster.

.. If the OLM catalogs are properly mirrored to an internal registry by using the original name and tag, add the `hypershift.openshift.io/olm-catalogs-is-registry-overrides` annotation to the `HostedCluster` resource. The format is `"sr1=dr1,sr2=dr2"`, where the source registry string is a key and the destination registry is a value.

.. To bypass the OLM catalog image stream mechanism, use the following four annotations on the `HostedCluster` resource to directly specify the addresses of the four images to use for OLM Operator catalogs:

** `hypershift.openshift.io/certified-operators-catalog-image`
** `hypershift.openshift.io/community-operators-catalog-image`
** `hypershift.openshift.io/redhat-marketplace-catalog-image`
** `hypershift.openshift.io/redhat-operators-catalog-image`

In this case, the image stream is not created, and you must update the value of the annotations when the internal mirror is refreshed to pull in Operator updates.

= Deploying AgentServiceConfig resources

The `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource is an essential component of the Assisted Service add-on that is part of {mce-short}. It is responsible for bare metal cluster deployment. When the add-on is enabled, you deploy the `AgentServiceConfig` resource to configure the add-on.

In addition to configuring the `AgentServiceConfig` resource, you need to include additional config maps to ensure that {mce-short} functions properly in a disconnected environment.

.Procedure

. Configure the custom registries by adding the following config map, which contains the disconnected details to customize the deployment:

The object contains two fields:

* Custom CAs: This field contains the Certificate Authorities (CAs) that are loaded into the various processes of the deployment.
* Registries: The `Registries.conf` field contains information about images and namespaces that need to be consumed from a mirror registry rather than the original source registry.

Typically, the HyperShift Operator creates the `HostedControlPlane` namespace. However, you might want to include all the objects before the HyperShift Operator begins to reconcile the `HostedCluster` object. Then, when the Operator starts the reconciliation process, it can find all of the objects in place.

= Creating an InfraEnv resource for the hosted cluster

The `InfraEnv` resource is an Assisted Service object that includes essential details, such as the `pullSecretRef` and the `sshAuthorizedKey`. Those details are used to create the {op-system-first} boot image that is customized for the hosted cluster.

You can host more than one `InfraEnv` resource, and each one can adopt certain types of hosts. For example, you might want to divide your server farm between a host that has greater RAM capacity.

.Procedure

= Creating bare metal hosts for the hosted cluster

A _bare metal host_ is an `openshift-machine-api` object that encompasses physical and logical details so that it can be identified by a Metal3 Operator. Those details are associated with other Assisted Service objects, known as _agents_.

.Prerequisites

* Before you create the bare metal host and destination nodes, you must have the destination machines ready.

* You have installed a {op-system-first} compute machine on bare-metal infrastructure for use in the cluster.

.Procedure

To create a bare metal host, complete the following steps:

. Create a YAML file with the following information. For more information about what details to enter for the bare metal host, see "Provisioning new hosts in a user-provisioned cluster by using the BMO".
+
Because you have at least one secret that holds the bare metal host credentials, you need to create at least two objects for each worker node.

= Scaling up the node pool

After you create the bare metal hosts, their statuses change from `Registering` to `Provisioning` to `Provisioned`. The nodes start with the `LiveISO` of the agent and a default pod that is named `agent`. That agent is responsible for receiving instructions from the Assisted Service Operator to install the OpenShift Container Platform payload.

.Procedure

. To scale up the node pool, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> scale nodepool <hosted_cluster_name> \
  --replicas 3
----
+
where:

* `<hosted_cluster_namespace>` is the name of the hosted cluster namespace.
* `<hosted_cluster_name>` is the name of the hosted cluster.

. After the scaling process is complete, notice that the agents are assigned to a hosted cluster:
