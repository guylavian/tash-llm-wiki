= RBAC overview

Role-based access control (RBAC) objects determine whether a user is allowed to
perform a given action within a project.

Cluster administrators
Administrators with the `dedicated-admin` role
can use the cluster roles and bindings to control who has various access levels to the OpenShift Container Platform platform itself and all projects.

Developers can use local roles and bindings to control who has access
to their projects. Note that authorization is a separate step from
authentication, which is more about determining the identity of who is taking the action.

Authorization is managed using:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|Authorization object |Description

|Rules |Sets of permitted verbs on a set of objects. For example,
whether a user or service account can `create` pods.

|Roles |Collections of rules. You can associate, or bind, users and groups
to multiple roles.

|Bindings |Associations between users and/or groups with a role.
|===

There are two levels of RBAC roles and bindings that control authorization:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|RBAC level |Description

|Cluster RBAC |Roles and bindings that are applicable across
all projects. _Cluster roles_ exist cluster-wide, and _cluster role bindings_
can reference only cluster roles.

|Local RBAC |Roles and bindings that are scoped to a given project. While
_local roles_ exist only in a single project, local role bindings can
reference _both_ cluster and local roles.

|===

A cluster role binding is a binding that exists at the cluster level.
A role binding exists at the project level. The cluster role _view_ must be
bound to a user using a local role binding for that user to view the project.
Create local roles only if a cluster role does not provide the set
of permissions needed for a particular situation.

This two-level hierarchy allows reuse across multiple projects through the
cluster roles while allowing customization inside of individual projects
through local roles.

During evaluation, both the cluster role bindings and the local role bindings are used.
For example:

. Cluster-wide "allow" rules are checked.
. Locally-bound "allow" rules are checked.
. Deny by default.

[id="default-roles_{context}"]
== Default cluster roles

OpenShift Container Platform includes a set of default cluster roles that you can bind to users and groups cluster-wide or locally.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not recommended to manually modify the default cluster roles. Modifications to these system roles can prevent a cluster from functioning properly.
====

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|Default cluster role |Description

|`admin` |A project manager. If used in a local binding, an `admin` has
rights to view any resource in the project and modify any resource in the
project except for quota.

|`basic-user` |A user that can get basic information about projects and users.

|`cluster-admin` |A super-user that can perform any action in any project. When
bound to a user with a local binding, they have full control over quota and
every action on every resource in the project.

|`cluster-status` |A user that can get basic cluster status information.

|`cluster-reader` | A user that can get or view most of the objects but
cannot modify them.

|`edit` |A user that can modify most objects in a project but does not have the
power to view or modify roles or bindings.

|`self-provisioner` |A user that can create their own projects.

|`view` |A user who cannot make any modifications, but can see most objects in a
project. They cannot view or modify roles or bindings.

|===

Be mindful of the difference between local and cluster bindings. For example,
if you bind the `cluster-admin` role to a user by using a local role binding,
it might appear that this user has the privileges of a cluster administrator.
This is not the case. Binding the `cluster-admin` to a user in a project
grants super administrator privileges for only that project to the user. That user has the permissions of the cluster role `admin`, plus a few additional permissions like the ability to edit rate limits, for that project. This binding can be confusing via the web console UI, which does not list cluster role bindings that are bound to true cluster administrators. However, it does list local role bindings that you can use to locally bind `cluster-admin`.

If you do, when you upgrade
your cluster, the default roles are updated and
automatically reconciled when the server is started. During reconciliation, any
permissions that are missing from
the default roles are added. If you added more permissions to the role, they are
not removed.

If you customized the default roles and configured them to prevent automatic
role reconciliation, you must manually update policy definitions
when you upgrade OpenShift Container Platform.

The relationships between cluster roles, local roles, cluster role bindings,
local role bindings, users, groups and service accounts are illustrated below.

[WARNING]
====
The `get pods/exec`, `get pods/*`, and `get *` rules grant execution privileges when they are applied to a role. Apply the principle of least privilege and assign only the minimal RBAC rights required for users and agents. For more information, see RBAC rules allow execution privileges.
====

[id="evaluating-authorization_{context}"]
== Evaluating authorization

OpenShift Container Platform evaluates authorization by using:

Identity:: The user name and list of groups that the user belongs to.

Action:: The action you perform. In most cases, this consists of:
* *Project*: The project you access. A project is a Kubernetes namespace with
additional annotations that allows a community of users to organize and manage
their content in isolation from other communities.
* *Verb* : The action itself:  `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `deletecollection`, or `watch`.
* *Resource name*: The API endpoint that you access.
Bindings:: The full list of bindings, the associations between users or groups
with a role.

OpenShift Container Platform evaluates authorization by using the following steps:

. The identity and the project-scoped action is used to find all bindings that
apply to the user or their groups.
. Bindings are used to locate all the roles that apply.
. Roles are used to find all the rules that apply.
. The action is checked against each rule to find a match.
. If no matching rule is found, the action is then denied by default.

[TIP]
====
Remember that users and groups can be associated with, or bound to, multiple
roles at the same time.
====

Project administrators can use the CLI to
view local roles and bindings,
including a matrix of the verbs and resources each are associated with.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cluster role bound to the project administrator is limited in a project
through a local binding. It is not bound cluster-wide like the cluster roles granted to the *cluster-admin* or *system:admin*.

Cluster roles are roles defined at the cluster level but can be bound either at
the cluster level or at the project level.
====

[id="cluster-role-aggregations_{context}"]
=== Cluster role aggregation
The default admin, edit, view, and cluster-reader cluster roles support
cluster role aggregation, where the cluster rules for each role are dynamically updated as new rules are created. This feature is relevant only if you extend the Kubernetes API by creating custom resources.

// NEED NEW LINK TO ASSEMBLY ABOUT making custom resources

[id="rbac-projects-namespaces_{context}"]
= Projects and namespaces

A Kubernetes _namespace_ provides a mechanism to scope resources in a cluster.
The
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces/[Kubernetes documentation]
has more information on namespaces.

Namespaces provide a unique scope for:

* Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions.
* Delegated management authority to trusted users.
* The ability to limit community resource consumption.

Most objects in the system are scoped by namespace, but some are
excepted and have no namespace, including nodes and users.

A _project_ is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations and is the central vehicle
by which access to resources for regular users is managed.
A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities. Users must be given access to projects by administrators,
or if allowed to create projects, automatically have access to their own projects.

Projects can have a separate `name`, `displayName`, and `description`.

- The mandatory `name` is a unique identifier for the project and is most visible when using the CLI tools or API. The maximum name length is 63 characters.
- The optional `displayName` is how the project is displayed in the web console (defaults to `name`).
- The optional `description` can be a more detailed description of the project and is also visible in the web console.

Each project scopes its own set of:

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|Object
|Description

|`Objects`
|Pods, services, replication controllers, etc.

|`Policies`
|Rules for which users can or cannot perform actions on objects.

|`Constraints`
|Quotas for each kind of object that can be limited.

|`Service accounts`
|Service accounts act automatically with designated access to objects in the project.

|===

Cluster administrators
Administrators with the `dedicated-admin` role
can create projects and delegate administrative rights for the project to any member of the user community.
Cluster administrators
Administrators with the `dedicated-admin` role
can also allow developers to create their own projects.

Developers and administrators can interact with projects by using the CLI or the
web console.

// * authentication/using-rbac.adoc
// * post_installation_configuration/preparing-for-users.adoc

[id="rbac-default-projects_{context}"]
= Default projects

OpenShift Container Platform comes with a number of default projects, and projects
starting with `openshift-` are the most essential to users.
These projects host master components that run as pods and other infrastructure
components. The pods created in these namespaces that have a
critical pod annotation
are considered critical, and the have guaranteed admission by kubelet.
Pods created for master components in these namespaces are already marked as
critical.

// * post_installation_configuration/preparing-for-users.adoc

[id="viewing-cluster-roles_{context}"]
= Viewing cluster roles and bindings

You can use the `oc` CLI to view cluster roles and bindings by using the
`oc describe` command.

.Prerequisites

* Install the `oc` CLI.
* Obtain permission to view the cluster roles and bindings.

Users with the `cluster-admin` default cluster role bound cluster-wide can
perform any action on any resource, including viewing cluster roles and bindings.

.Procedure

. To view the cluster roles and their associated rule sets:

= Viewing local roles and bindings

You can use the `oc` CLI to view local roles and bindings by using the
`oc describe` command.

.Prerequisites

* Install the `oc` CLI.
* Obtain permission to view the local roles and bindings:

** Users with the `cluster-admin` default cluster role bound cluster-wide can
perform any action on any resource, including viewing local roles and bindings.

** Users with the `admin` default cluster role bound locally can view and manage
roles and bindings in that project.

.Procedure

. To view the current set of local role bindings, which show the users and groups
that are bound to various roles for the current project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac
----

. To view the local role bindings for a different project, add the `-n` flag
to the command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n joe-project
----

[id="adding-roles_{context}"]
= Adding roles to users

You can use  the `oc adm` administrator CLI to manage the roles and bindings.

Binding, or adding, a role to users or groups gives the user or group the access
that is granted by the role. You can add and remove roles to and from users and
groups using `oc adm policy` commands.

You can bind any of the default cluster roles to local users or groups in your
project.

.Procedure

. Add a role to a user in a specific project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user <role> <user> -n <project>
----
+
For example, you can add the `admin` role to the `alice` user in `joe` project
by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin alice -n joe
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role to the user:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: admin-0
  namespace: joe
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: admin
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: alice
----
====

. View the local role bindings and verify the addition in the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n <project>
----
+
For example, to view the local role bindings for the `joe` project:

= Creating a local role

You can create a local role for a project and then bind it to a user.

.Procedure

. To create a local role for a project, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create role <name> --verb=<verb> --resource=<resource> -n <project>
----
+
In this command, specify:

= Creating a cluster admin

The `cluster-admin` role is required to perform administrator
level tasks on the OpenShift Container Platform cluster, such as modifying
cluster resources.

.Prerequisites

* You must have created a user to define as the cluster admin.

.Procedure

* Define the user as a cluster admin:
+

[id="rosa-create-cluster-admins_{context}"]
= Granting `cluster-admin` access

[role="_abstract"]
As the user who created the cluster, add the `cluster-admin` user role to your account to have the maximum administrator privileges. These privileges are not automatically assigned to your user account when you create the cluster.

Additionally, only the user who created the cluster can grant cluster access to other `cluster-admin` or `dedicated-admin` users. Users with `dedicated-admin` access have fewer privileges. As a best practice, limit the number of `cluster-admin` users to as few as possible.

.Prerequisites

* You have added an identity provider (IDP) to your cluster.
* You have the IDP user name for the user you are creating.
* You are logged in to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Give your user `cluster-admin` privileges:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa grant user cluster-admin --user=<idp_user_name> --cluster=<cluster_name>
----
+
. Verify your user is listed as a cluster administrator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list users --cluster=<cluster_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
GROUP             NAME
cluster-admins    rh-rosa-test-user
dedicated-admins  rh-rosa-test-user
----
+
. Enter the following command to verify that your user now has `cluster-admin` access. A cluster administrator can run this command without errors, but a dedicated administrator cannot.

[role="_abstract"]
Only the user who created the cluster can grant cluster access to other `cluster-admin` or `dedicated-admin` users. Users with `dedicated-admin` access have fewer privileges. As a best practice, grant `dedicated-admin` access to most of your administrators.

.Prerequisites

* You have added an identity provider (IDP) to your cluster.
* You have the IDP user name for the user you are creating.
* You are logged in to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Enter the following command to promote your user to a `dedicated-admin`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa grant user dedicated-admin --user=<idp_user_name> --cluster=<cluster_name>
----
+
. Enter the following command to verify that your user now has `dedicated-admin` access:

After you have configured an identity provider for your cluster and added a user to the identity provider, you can grant `dedicated-admin` cluster privileges to the user.

.Prerequisites

* You logged in to {cluster-manager-url}.
* You created an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You configured an identity provider for your cluster.

.Procedure

. Navigate to {cluster-manager-url} and select your cluster.

. Click the *Access control* tab.

. In the *Cluster Roles and Access* tab, click *Add user*.

. Enter the user ID of an identity provider user.

. Click *Add user* to grant `dedicated-admin` cluster privileges to the user.

.Verification

* After granting the privileges, the user is listed as part of the `dedicated-admins` group under *Access control* -> *Cluster Roles and Access* on the {cluster-manager} page for your cluster.

[id="unauthenticated-users-cluster-role-bindings-concept_{context}"]
= Cluster role bindings for unauthenticated groups

[NOTE]
====
Before OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, unauthenticated groups were allowed access to some cluster roles. Clusters updated from versions before OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 retain this access for unauthenticated groups.
====

For security reasons OpenShift Container Platform  does not allow unauthenticated groups to have default access to cluster roles.

There are use cases where it might be necessary to add `system:unauthenticated` to a cluster role.

Cluster administrators can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles:

* `system:scope-impersonation`
* `system:webhook`
* `system:oauth-token-deleter`
* `self-access-reviewer`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always verify compliance with your organization's security standards when modifying unauthenticated access.
