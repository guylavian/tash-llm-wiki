# Hot-plug virtual disks to running VMs

[id="virt-hot-plugging-virtual-disks"]
= Hot-plug virtual disks to running VMs

[role="_abstract"]
You can hot-plug or hot-unplug virtual disks from running VMs to dynamically adjust storage without downtime.

Only data volumes and persistent volume claims (PVCs) can be hot plugged and hot-unplugged. You cannot hot plug or hot-unplug container disks.

A hot plugged disk remains attached to the VM even after reboot. You must unplug the disk to remove it from the VM.

[NOTE]
====
Each VM has a `virtio-scsi` controller so that hot plugged disks can use the SCSI bus. The `virtio-scsi` controller overcomes the limitations of VirtIO while retaining its performance advantages. It is highly scalable and supports hot plugging over 4 million disks.

When you hot plug disks to the VirtIO (`virtio-blk`) bus, each disk uses a PCI Express (PCIe) slot in the VM. The number of PCIe slots is limited and pre-set automatically at the VM creation as specified in the "Available VirtIO Ports" table. Therefore, you can use `virtio-blk` for a small number of disks that does not exceed the number of available slots.

= Hot plugging and hot unplugging a disk by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can hot plug a disk by attaching it to a virtual machine (VM) while the VM is running by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

The hot plugged disk remains attached to the VM until you unplug it.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a data volume or persistent volume claim (PVC) available for hot plugging.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* in the web console.
. Select a running VM to view its details.
. On the *VirtualMachine details* page, click *Configuration* -> *Storage*.

. Add a hot plugged disk:
.. Click *Add*.
.. In the *Add disk (hot plugged)* window, select the disk from the *Source* list and click *Save*.
. Optional: Select the type of the interface bus. The options are *VirtIO* and *SCSI*. The default bus type is *VirtIO*.
. Optional: Change the type of the interface bus of an existing hot plugged disk:
.. Click the Options menu {kebab} beside the disk and select the *Edit* option.
.. In the *Interface* field, select the desired option.
. Optional: Unplug a hot plugged disk:
.. Click the Options menu {kebab} beside the disk and select *Detach*.
.. Click *Detach*.

= Hot plugging and hot unplugging a disk by using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can hot plug and hot unplug a disk while a virtual machine (VM) is running by using the command line.

The hot plugged disk remains attached to the VM until you unplug it.

.Prerequisites

* You must have at least one data volume or persistent volume claim (PVC) available for hot plugging.

.Procedure

* Hot plug a disk by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl addvolume <virtual-machine|virtual-machine-instance> \
  --volume-name=<datavolume|PVC> \
  [--bus <bus_type>] [--serial=<label_name>]
----
+
** The optional `--bus` flag allows you to specify the bus type of the added disk. The options are `virtio` and `scsi`. The default bus type is `virtio`.
** The optional `--serial` flag allows you to add an alphanumeric string label of your choice. This helps you to identify the hot plugged disk in a guest virtual machine. If you do not specify this option, the label defaults to the name of the hot plugged data volume or PVC.

* Hot unplug a disk by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl removevolume <virtual-machine|virtual-machine-instance> \
  --volume-name=<datavolume|PVC>
