# Configuring the integration of MetalLB and FRR-K8s

[id="metallb-configure-frr-k8s"]
= Configuring the integration of MetalLB and FRR-K8s

[role="_abstract"]
To access advanced routing services not natively provided by MetalLB, configure the `FRRConfiguration` custom resource (CR). Defining the CR exposes specific FRRouting (FRR) capabilities and extends the routing functionality of your cluster beyond standard MetalLB advertisements.

FRRouting (FRR) is a free, open-source internet routing protocol suite for Linux and UNIX platforms. `FRR-K8s` is a Kubernetes-based DaemonSet that exposes a subset of the `FRR` API in a Kubernetes-compliant manner. `MetalLB` generates the `FRR-K8s` configuration corresponding to the MetalLB configuration applied.

[WARNING]
====
When configuring Virtual Route Forwarding (VRF), you must change the VRFs to a table ID lower than `1000` as higher than `1000` is reserved for OpenShift Container Platform.

[role="_abstract"]
You can create multiple `FRRConfiguration` CRs to use `FRR` services in `MetalLB`.

`MetalLB` generates an `FRRConfiguration` object which `FRR-K8s` merges with all other configurations that all users have created. For example, you can configure `FRR-K8s` to receive all of the prefixes advertised by a given neighbor. The following example configures `FRR-K8s` to receive all of the prefixes advertised by a `BGPPeer` with host `172.18.0.5`:

.Example FRRConfiguration CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
 name: test
 namespace: metallb-system
spec:

       asn: 64512
       toReceive:
        allowed:
            mode: all
# ...
----

You can also configure FRR-K8s to always block a set of prefixes, regardless of the configuration applied. This is useful to prevent routes to pod or `ClusterIPs` CIDRs that might cause cluster malfunctions. For example, you might block the `clusterNetwork` and `serviceNetwork` CIDRs. Run `oc describe network.config/cluster` to find these values.

The following example blocks the prefix `192.168.1.0/24`:

[role="_abstract"]
To customize routing behavior beyond standard MetalLB capabilities, configure the `FRRConfiguration` custom resource (CR).

The following reference examples demonstrate how to define specific FRRouting (FRR) parameters to enable advanced services, such as receiving routes:

The `routers` parameter::
+
--
You can use the `routers` parameter to configure multiple routers, one for each Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) resource. For each router, you must define the Autonomous System Number (ASN).

You can also define a list of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) neighbors to connect to, as in the following example:

.Example FRRConfiguration CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: frr-k8s-system
spec:
  bgp:
    routers:
    - asn: 64512
      neighbors:
      - address: 172.30.0.3
        asn: 4200000000
        ebgpMultiHop: true
        port: 180
      - address: 172.18.0.6
        asn: 4200000000
        port: 179
# ...
----
--

The `toAdvertise` parameter::
+
--
By default, `FRR-K8s` does not advertise the prefixes configured as part of a router configuration. To advertise the prefixes, you use the `toAdvertise` parameter.

You can advertise a subset of the prefixes, as in the following example:

.Example FRRConfiguration CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: frr-k8s-system

    - asn: 64512
      neighbors:
      - address: 172.30.0.3
        asn: 4200000000
        ebgpMultiHop: true
        port: 180
        toAdvertise:
          allowed:
            prefixes:
            - 192.168.2.0/24
      prefixes:
        - 192.168.2.0/24
        - 192.169.2.0/24
# ...
----
* `allowed.prefixes`: Advertises a subset of prefixes.

The following example shows you how to advertise all of the prefixes:

.Example FRRConfiguration CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1

        asn: 4200000000
        ebgpMultiHop: true
        port: 180
        toAdvertise:
          allowed:
            mode: all
      prefixes:
        - 192.168.2.0/24
        - 192.169.2.0/24
# ...
----
* `allowed.mode`: Advertises all prefixes.
--

The `toReceive` parameter::
+
--
By default, `FRR-K8s` does not process any prefixes advertised by a neighbor. You can use the `toReceive` parameter to process such addresses.

You can configure for a subset of the prefixes, as in this example:

.Example FRRConfiguration CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration

          port: 179
          toReceive:
            allowed:
              prefixes:
              - prefix: 192.168.1.0/24
              - prefix: 192.169.2.0/24
                ge: 25
                le: 28
# ...
----
* `prefixes`: The prefix is applied if the prefix length is less than or equal to the `le` prefix length and greater than or equal to the `ge` prefix length.

The following example configures FRR to handle all the prefixes announced:

.Example FRRConfiguration CR

          toReceive:
            allowed:
              mode: all
# ...
----
--

The `bgp` parameter::
+
--
You can use the `bgp` parameter to define various `BFD` profiles and associate them with a neighbor. In the following example, `BFD` backs up the `BGP` session and `FRR` can detect link failures:

        bfdProfile: defaultprofile
    bfdProfiles:
      - name: defaultprofile
# ...
----
--

The `nodeSelector` parameter::
+
--
By default, `FRR-K8s` applies the configuration to all nodes where the daemon is running.
You can use the `nodeSelector` parameter to specify the nodes to which you want to apply the configuration. For example:

            mode: filtered
      prefixes:
      - 5.5.5.5/32
# ...
----
* `neighbors.interface`: Activates unnumbered BGP peering.

[NOTE]
====
To use the `interface` parameter, you must establish a point-to-point, layer 2 connection between the two BGP peers. You can use unnumbered BGP peering with IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack, but you must enable IPv6 RAs (Router Advertisements). Each interface is limited to one BGP connection.

If you use this parameter, you cannot specify a value in the `spec.bgp.routers.neighbors.address` parameter.

[id="nw-metallb-frr-k8s-merge-multiple-configurations_{context}"]
= How FRR-K8s merges multiple configurations

[role="_abstract"]
FRR-K8s uses an additive merge strategy when multiple users configure the same node. By using FRR-K8s, you can extend existing configurations, such as adding neighbors or prefixes, but prevent the removal of components defined by other sources.

Configuration conflicts::

Certain configurations can cause conflicts, leading to errors, for example:

* different ASN for the same router (in the same VRF)
* different ASN for the same neighbor (with the same IP / port)
* multiple BFD profiles with the same name but different values

When the daemon finds an invalid configuration for a node, it reports the configuration as invalid and reverts to the previous valid `FRR` configuration.

Merging::

When merging, you can complete the following actions:

* Extend the set of IP addresses that you want to advertise to a neighbor.
* Add an extra neighbor with its set of IP addresses.
* Extend the set of IP addresses to which you want to associate a community.
* Allow incoming routes for a neighbor.

Each configuration must be self contained. This means, for example, that you cannot allow prefixes that are not defined in the router section by leveraging prefixes coming from another configuration.

If the configurations to be applied are compatible, merging works as follows:

* `FRR-K8s` combines all the routers.
* `FRR-K8s` merges all prefixes and neighbors for each router.
* `FRR-K8s` merges all filters for each neighbor.

[NOTE]
====
A less restrictive filter has precedence over a stricter one. For example, a filter accepting some prefixes has precedence over a filter not accepting any, and a filter accepting all prefixes has precedence over one that accepts some.
