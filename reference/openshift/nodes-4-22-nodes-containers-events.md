# Viewing system event information in {product-title} clusters

[id="nodes-containers-events"]
= Viewing system event information in OpenShift Container Platform clusters

[role="_abstract"]
You can view events in OpenShift Container Platform, which are based on events that happen to API objects in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * nodes/nodes-containers-events.adoc

[id="nodes-containers-events-about_{context}"]
= Understanding events

[role="_abstract"]
Review the following information to learn how OpenShift Container Platform uses _events_ to record information about real-world events in a resource-agnostic manner. Events also allow developers and administrators to consume information about system components in a unified way.

[id="event-failure-notifications_{context}"]
== Failure Notifications

For each of your projects, you can choose to receive email notifications about various failures, including dead or failed deployments, dead builds, and dead or failed persistent volume claims (PVCs).

See Notifications.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * nodes/nodes-containers-events.adoc

[id="nodes-containers-events-viewing-cli_{context}"]
= Viewing events using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can get a list of events in a given project by using the CLI.

.Procedure

* View events in a project by using a command similar to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get events [-n <project>]
----
where:
+
--
`project`:: Specifies the name of the project.
--
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get events -n openshift-config
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

* View events in your project from the OpenShift Container Platform console:
+
. Launch the OpenShift Container Platform console.
+
. Click *Home* -> *Events* and select your project.

. Move to resource that you want to see events. For example: *Home* -> *Projects* -> <project-name> -> <resource-name>.
+
Many objects, such as pods and deployments, also have an *Events* tab, which shows events related to that object.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
