# Chapter 3. Bootstrapping and recovering an admin account - Red Hat build of Keycloak 26.2 Server Configuration Guide

Chapter 3. Bootstrapping and recovering an admin account
Bootstrap Red Hat build of Keycloak and recover access by creating a temporary admin account.
3.1. A temporary admin account
A user or service admin account created using one of the methods described below is temporary. This means the account should exist only for the duration necessary to perform operations needed to gain permanent and more secure admin access. After that, the account needs to be removed manually. Various UI/UX elements, such as the Administration Console warning banner, labels, and log messages, will indicate to a Red Hat build of Keycloak administrator that the account is temporary.
3.2. Bootstrapping a temporary admin account at Red Hat build of Keycloak startup
Red Hat build of Keycloak start
and start-dev
commands support options for bootstrapping both temporary admin users and admin service accounts. These options are standard configuration options, so they can be specified in any of the configuration sources such as environment variables or CLI parameters. For instance, the following examples demonstrate how to use the start
and start-dev
commands with CLI parameters to bootstrap a temporary admin user and an admin service account, respectively:
bin/kc.[sh|bat] start --bootstrap-admin-username tmpadm --bootstrap-admin-password pass
bin/kc.[sh|bat] start-dev --bootstrap-admin-client-id tmpadm --bootstrap-admin-client-secret secret
The username or client ID values can be omitted; see the Section 3.5, “Default values” section below for more information.
The purpose of these options is solely for bootstrapping temporary admin accounts. These accounts will be created only during the initial start of the Red Hat build of Keycloak server when the master realm doesn’t exist yet. The accounts are always created in the master realm. For recovering lost admin access, use the dedicated command described in the sections below.
3.3. Bootstrapping an admin user or service account using the dedicated command
The bootstrap-admin
command can be executed even before the first-ever start of Red Hat build of Keycloak. Bear in mind that all the Red Hat build of Keycloak nodes need to be stopped prior to using this command. Its execution will trigger the creation of the initial master realm, and as a result, the startup options to bootstrap the admin user and service account will be ignored later when the server is started for the first time.
Additionally, it is strongly recommended to use the dedicated command with the same options that the Red Hat build of Keycloak server is started with (e.g., db
options).
If you have built an optimized version of Red Hat build of Keycloak with the build
command as outlined in Configuring Red Hat build of Keycloak, use the command line option --optimized
to have Red Hat build of Keycloak skip the build check for a faster startup time. When doing this, remove the build time options from the command line and keep only the runtime options.
if you do not use --optimized
keep in mind that an bootstrap-admin
command will implicitly create or update an optimized image for you - if you are running the command from the same machine as a server instance, this may impact the next start of your server.
3.3.1. Create an admin user
To create a temporary admin user, execute the following command:
bin/kc.[sh|bat] bootstrap-admin user
If no other parameters are specified and/or no corresponding environment variables are set, the user is prompted to enter the required information. The username value can be omitted to use the default values. For more information, see the Section 3.5, “Default values” and Section 3.7, “Environment variables” sections below.
Alternatively, the parameters can be directly specified in the command:
bin/kc.[sh|bat] bootstrap-admin user --username tmpadm --password:env PASS_VAR
This command creates a temporary admin user with the username tmpadm
and the password retrieved from the environment variable.
3.3.2. Create a service account
In automated scenarios, a temporary admin service account can be a more suitable alternative to a temporary admin user.
To create a temporary admin service account, execute the following command:
bin/kc.[sh|bat] bootstrap-admin service
Similarly, if no corresponding environment variables or additional parameters are set, the user will be prompted to enter the required information. The client ID value can be omitted to use the default values. For more information, see the Section 3.5, “Default values” and Section 3.7, “Environment variables” sections below.
Alternatively, the parameters can be directly specified in the command:
bin/kc.[sh|bat] bootstrap-admin service --client-id tmpclient --client-secret:env=SECRET_VAR
This command creates a temporary admin service account with the client ID tmpclient
and the secret retrieved from the environment variable.
3.4. Regaining access to the realm with an increased security
Passwordless, OTP, or other advanced authentication methods can be enforced for a realm with lost admin access. In such a case, the admin service account needs to be created to recover lost admin access to the realm. After the service account is created, authentication against the Red Hat build of Keycloak instance is required to perform all necessary operations:
bin/kcadm.[sh|bat] config credentials --server http://localhost:8080 --realm master --client <service_account_client_name> --secret <service_account_secret>
Next, retrieve the credentialId
. For this example, the OTP credential is the relevant one. Use the following command to get an array of CredentialRepresentation
objects and find the one with type
set to otp
:
bin/kcadm.[sh|bat] get users/{userId}/credentials -r {realm-name}
Finally, the retrieved ID can be used to remove the advanced authentication method (in our case, OTP):
bin/kcadm.[sh|bat] delete users/{userId}/credentials/{credentialId} -r {realm-name}
3.5. Default values
For both the startup and dedicated command scenarios, the username and client ID are optional and default to temp-admin
for both the user and service account, respectively.
3.6. Disable the parameters prompt
To disable the prompt for the parameters, the --no-prompt
parameter can be used. For example:
bin/kc.[sh|bat] bootstrap-admin user --username tmpadm --no-prompt
If no corresponding environment variable is set, the command will fail with an error message indicating that the required password parameter is missing.
The --no-prompt
parameter can be useful if the username or client ID should be omitted. For example:
bin/kc.[sh|bat] bootstrap-admin user --password:env PASS_VAR --no-prompt
This creates a temporary admin user with the default username without prompting for confirmation. For more information, see the Section 3.5, “Default values” section above.
3.7. Environment variables
For the bootstrap-admin user
command, both username and password can be optionally set as environment variables:
bin/kc.[sh|bat] bootstrap-admin user --username:env <YourUsernameEnv> --password:env <YourPassEnv>
For the bootstrap-admin service
command, the client ID is optional and defaults to temp-admin
, while the client secret is required to be set as an environment variable:
bin/kc.[sh|bat] bootstrap-admin service --client-id:env <YourClientIdEnv> --client-secret:env <YourSecretEnv>
