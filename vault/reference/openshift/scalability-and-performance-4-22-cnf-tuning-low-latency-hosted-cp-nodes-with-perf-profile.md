# Tuning hosted control planes for low latency with the performance profile

[id="cnf-tuning-low-latency-hosted-cp-nodes-with-perf-profile"]
= Tuning hosted control planes for low latency with the performance profile

[role="_abstract"]
Tune hosted control planes for low latency by applying a performance profile. With the performance profile, you can restrict CPUs for infrastructure and application containers and configure huge pages, Hyper-Threading, and CPU partitions for latency-sensitive processes.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * scalability_and_performance/low_latency_tuning/cnf-tuning-low-latency-nodes-with-perf-profile.adoc

[id="cnf-create-performance-profiles-hosted-cp_{context}"]
= Creating a performance profile for hosted control planes

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a cluster performance profile by using the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool. The PPC is a function of the Node Tuning Operator.

The PPC combines information about your cluster with user-supplied configurations to generate a performance profile that is appropriate to your hardware, topology, and use-case. The following high-level workflow creates and applys a performance profile in your cluster:

. Gather information about your cluster by using the `must-gather` command.
. Use the PPC tool to create a performance profile.
. Apply the performance profile to your cluster.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * scalability_and_performance/low_latency_tuning/cnf-tuning-low-latency-nodes-with-perf-profile.adoc

[id="gathering-data-about-your-hosted-cluster-using-must-gather_{context}"]
= Gathering data about your hosted control planes cluster for the PPC

[role="_abstract"]
The Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool requires `must-gather` data. As a cluster administrator, run the `must-gather` command to capture information about your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have `cluster-admin` role access to the management cluster.
* You installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Export the management cluster `kubeconfig` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export MGMT_KUBECONFIG=<path_to_mgmt_kubeconfig>
----

. List all node pools across all namespaces by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig="$MGMT_KUBECONFIG" get np -A
----
+
.Example output

[id="running-the-performance-profile-profile-hosted-cluster-using-podman_{context}"]
= Running the Performance Profile Creator on a hosted cluster using Podman

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can use Podman with the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool to create a performance profile.

For more information about PPC arguments, see "Performance Profile Creator arguments".

The PPC tool is designed to be hosted-cluster aware. When it detects a hosted cluster from the `must-gather` data it automatically takes the following actions:

* Recognizes that there is no machine config pool (MCP).
* Uses node pools as the source of truth for compute node configurations instead of MCPs.
* Does not require you to specify the `node-pool-name` value explicitly unless you want to target a specific pool.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The PPC uses the `must-gather` data from your hosted cluster to create the performance profile. If you make any changes to your cluster, such as relabeling a node targeted for performance configuration, you must re-create the `must-gather` data before running PPC again.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* A hosted cluster is installed.
* Installation of Podman and the {oc-first}.
* Access to the Node Tuning Operator image.
* Access to the `must-gather` data for your cluster.

.Procedure

. On the hosted cluster, use Podman to authenticate to `registry.redhat.io` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----
+
[source,bash]
----
Username: <user_name>
Password: <password>
----

. Create a performance profile on the hosted cluster, by running the following command. The example uses sample PPC arguments and values:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]

$ podman run --entrypoint performance-profile-creator \

= Configuring low-latency tuning in a hosted cluster

[role="_abstract"]
To set low latency with the performance profile on the nodes in your hosted cluster, you can use the Node Tuning Operator. In {hcp}, you can configure low-latency tuning by creating config maps that contain `Tuned` objects and referencing those config maps in your node pools.

The tuned object in this case is a `PerformanceProfile` object that defines the performance profile you want to apply to the nodes in a node pool.

.Procedure

. Export the management cluster `kubeconfig` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export MGMT_KUBECONFIG=<path_to_mgmt_kubeconfig>
----

. Create the `ConfigMap` object in the management cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig="$MGMT_KUBECONFIG" apply -f my-hosted-cp-performance-profile.yaml
----

. Edit the `NodePool` object in the `clusters` namespace adding the `spec.tuningConfig` field and the name of the created performance profile in that field by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc edit np -n clusters

[NOTE]
====
You can reference the same profile in multiple node pools. In {hcp}, the Node Tuning Operator appends a hash of the node pool name and namespace to the name of the `Tuned` custom resources to distinguish them. After you make the changes, the system detects that a configuration change is required and starts a rolling update of the nodes in that pool to apply the new configuration.
