# Exposing binding data from a service

[id="exposing-binding-data-from-a-service"]
= Exposing binding data from a service

[role="_abstract"]
Application developers need access to backing services to build and connect workloads. Connecting workloads to backing services is always a challenge because each service provider requires a different way to access their secrets and consume them in a workload.

The {servicebinding-title} enables application developers to easily bind workloads together with operator-managed backing services, without any manual procedures to configure the binding connection. For the {servicebinding-title} to provide the binding data, as an Operator provider or user who creates backing services, you must expose the binding data to be automatically detected by the {servicebinding-title}. Then, the {servicebinding-title} automatically collects the binding data from the backing service and shares it with a workload to provide a consistent and predictable experience.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * /applications/connecting_applications_to_services/exposing-binding-data-from-a-service.adoc

[id="sbo-methods-of-exposing-binding-data_{context}"]
= Methods of exposing binding data

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes the methods you can use to expose the binding data.

Ensure that you know and understand your workload requirements and environment, and how it works with the provided services.

Binding data is exposed under the following circumstances:

* Backing service is available as a provisioned service resource.
+
The service you intend to connect to is compliant with the Service Binding specification. You must create a `Secret` resource with all the required binding data values and reference it in the backing service custom resource (CR). The detection of all the binding data values is automatic.

* Backing service is not available as a provisioned service resource.
+
You must expose the binding data from the backing service. Depending on your workload requirements and environment, you can choose any of the following methods to expose the binding data:
+
** Direct secret reference
** Declaring binding data through custom resource definition (CRD) or CR annotations
// ** Declaring binding data through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) descriptors
// When the OLM descriptors are supported again, add this sentence.
** Detection of binding data through owned resources

[id="provisioned-service_{context}"]
== Provisioned service
Provisioned service represents a backing service CR with a reference to a `Secret` resource placed in the `.status.binding.name` field of the backing service CR.

As an Operator provider or the user who creates backing services, you can use this method to be compliant with the Service Binding specification, by creating a `Secret` resource and referencing it in the `.status.binding.name` section of the backing service CR. This `Secret` resource must provide all the binding data values required for a workload to connect to the backing service.

The following examples show an `AccountService` CR that represents a backing service and a `Secret` resource referenced from the CR.

.Example: `AccountService` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
kind: AccountService
name: prod-account-service
spec:
# ...
status:
  binding:
    name: hippo-pguser-hippo
----

.Example: Referenced `Secret` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: hippo-pguser-hippo
data:
  password: "<password>"
  user: "<username>"
# ...
----

When creating a service binding resource, you can directly give the details of the `AccountService` resource in the `ServiceBinding` specification as follows:

.Example: `ServiceBinding` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: account-service
spec:
# ...
  services:
  - group: "example.com"
    version: v1alpha1
    kind: AccountService
    name: prod-account-service
  application:
    name: spring-petclinic
    group: apps
    version: v1
    resource: deployments
----

.Example: `ServiceBinding` resource in Specification API
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: servicebinding.io/v1beta1

    kind: AccountService
    name: prod-account-service
  workload:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: spring-petclinic
----

This method exposes all the keys in the `hippo-pguser-hippo` referenced `Secret` resource as binding data that is to be projected into the workload.

[id="direct-secret-reference_{context}"]
== Direct secret reference
You can use this method, if all the required binding data values are available in a `Secret` resource that you can reference in your Service Binding definition. In this method, a `ServiceBinding` resource directly references a `Secret` resource to connect to a service. All the keys in the `Secret` resource are exposed as binding data.

.Example: Specification with the `binding.operators.coreos.com` API
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: account-service

apiVersion: servicebinding.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: account-service
spec:
# ...
  service:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    name: hippo-pguser-hippo
----

[id="declaring-binding-data-through-CRD-or-CR-annotations_{context}"]
== Declaring binding data through CRD or CR annotations
You can use this method to annotate the resources of the backing service to expose the binding data with specific annotations. Adding annotations under the `metadata` section alters the CRs and CRDs of the backing services. {servicebinding-title} detects the annotations added to the CRs and CRDs and then creates a `Secret` resource with the values extracted based on the annotations.

The following examples show the annotations that are added under the `metadata` section and a referenced `ConfigMap` object from a resource:

.Example: Exposing binding data from a `Secret` object defined in the CR annotations
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1
kind: PostgresCluster
metadata:
  name: hippo
  namespace: my-petclinic
  annotations:
    service.binding: 'path={.metadata.name}-pguser-{.metadata.name},objectType=Secret'
# ...
----

The previous example places the name of the secret name in the `{.metadata.name}-pguser-{.metadata.name}` template that resolves to `hippo-pguser-hippo`. The template can contain multiple JSONPath expressions.

.Example: Referenced `Secret` object from a resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: hippo-pguser-hippo
data:
  password: "<password>"
  user: "<username>"
----

.Example: Exposing binding data from a `ConfigMap` object defined in the CR annotations
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1
kind: PostgresCluster
metadata:
  name: hippo
  namespace: my-petclinic
  annotations:
    service.binding: 'path={.metadata.name}-config,objectType=ConfigMap'
# ...
----

The previous example places the name of the config map in the `{.metadata.name}-config` template that resolves to `hippo-config`. The template can contain multiple JSONPath expressions.

.Example: Referenced `ConfigMap` object from a resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: hippo-config
data:
  db_timeout: "10s"
  user: "hippo"
----

[id="declaring-binding-data-through-olm-descriptors_{context}"]
== Declaring binding data through OLM descriptors
You can use this method if your backing service is provided by an Operator. If your Operator is distributed as an OLM bundle, you can add OLM descriptors to describe the binding data that is to be exposed. The OLM descriptors are part of Cluster Service Version resources. The {servicebinding-title} detects the OLM descriptors and then creates a `Secret` resource with the values extracted based on the detected OLM descriptors.

You can expose the binding data by using the `specDescriptors` array and `statusDescriptors` array. The `specDescriptors` array specifies a path under the `.spec` section of a CR. The `statusDescriptors` array specifies a path under the `.status` section of a CR.

Following are the only two fields that are used for binding the data:

* `Path`: A dot-delimited path of the field on the object as described by the descriptor.
*  `X-Descriptors`: Defines the binding data.

The following examples show how to define an X-Descriptor depending on the resource to which you point the path:

.Example: X-Descriptor definition for exposing a secret
[source,yaml]
----
- path: data.dbConfiguration
  x-descriptors:
  - urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:Secret
  - service.binding
----

.Example: X-Descriptor definition for exposing a config map
[source,yaml]
----
- path: data.dbConfiguration
  x-descriptors:
  - urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:ConfigMap
  - service.binding
----

[NOTE]
====
* You must have a `service.binding` entry in the X-Descriptors to identify that it is a configuration for service binding.
* The absence of the `Secret` or `ConfigMap` specific X-Descriptors indicates that the descriptor is referencing the binding data value at the given path.
====
// When the OLM descriptors are supported again, add this section.

[id="detection-of-binding-data-through-owned-resources_{context}"]
== Detection of binding data through owned resources
You can use this method if your backing service owns one or more Kubernetes resources such as route, service, config map, or secret that you can use to detect the binding data. In this method, the {servicebinding-title} detects the binding data from resources owned by the backing service CR.

The following examples show the `detectBindingResources` API option set to `true` in the `ServiceBinding` CR:

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: spring-petclinic-detect-all
  namespace: my-petclinic
spec:
  detectBindingResources: true
  services:
    - group: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com
      version: v1beta1
      kind: PostgresCluster
      name: hippo
  application:
    name: spring-petclinic
    group: apps
    version: v1
    resource: deployments
----

In the previous example, `PostgresCluster` custom service resource owns one or more Kubernetes resources such as route, service, config map, or secret.

The {servicebinding-title} automatically detects the binding data exposed on each of the owned resources.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * /applications/connecting_applications_to_services/exposing-binding-data-from-a-service.adoc

[id="sbo-data-model_{context}"]
= Data model

[role="_abstract"]
// The data model used in the annotations and OLM descriptors follow specific conventions.
// When the OLM descriptors are supported again, add this sentence.

The data model used in the annotations follows specific conventions.

Service binding annotations must use the following convention:

[source,yaml]
----
service.binding(/<NAME>)?:
    "<VALUE>|(path=<JSONPATH_TEMPLATE>(,objectType=<OBJECT_TYPE>)?(,elementType=<ELEMENT_TYPE>)?(,sourceKey=<SOURCE_KEY>)?(,sourceValue=<SOURCE_VALUE>)?)"
----
where:
[horizontal]
`<NAME>`:: Specifies the name under which the binding value is to be exposed. You can exclude it only when the `objectType` parameter is set to `Secret` or `ConfigMap`.
`<VALUE>`:: Specifies the constant value exposed when no `path` is set.

// Although, the data model is the same for custom resource definitions (CRD), custom resource (CR) annotations, and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) descriptors, the syntax for each one differs.
// When the OLM descriptors are supported again, add this sentence.

The data model provides the details on the allowed values and semantic for the `path`, `elementType`, `objectType`, `sourceKey`, and `sourceValue` parameters.

.Parameters and their descriptions
[cols="3,6,4",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Description
|Default value

|`path`
|JSONPath template that consists JSONPath expressions enclosed by curly braces {}.
|N/A

|`elementType`
a|Specifies whether the value of the element referenced in the `path` parameter complies with any one of the following types:

* `string`
* `sliceOfStrings`
* `sliceOfMaps`
|`string`

|`objectType`
|Specifies whether the value of the element indicated in the `path` parameter refers to a `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, or plain string in the current namespace.

[id="sbo-setting-annotations-mapping-optional_{context}"]
= Setting annotations mapping to be optional

You can have optional fields in the annotations. For example, a path to the credentials might not be present if the service endpoint does not require authentication. In such cases, a field might not exist in the target path of the annotations. As a result, {servicebinding-title} generates an error, by default.

As a service provider, to indicate whether you require annotations mapping, you can set a value for the `optional` flag in your annotations when enabling services. {servicebinding-title} provides annotations mapping only if the target path is available. When the target path is not available, the {servicebinding-title} skips the optional mapping and continues with the projection of the existing mappings without throwing any errors.

.Procedure

* To make a field in the annotations optional, set the `optional` flag value to `true`:
+
.Example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.example.org/v1beta1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: my-db
  namespace: my-petclinic
  annotations:
    service.binding/username: path={.spec.name},optional=true
# ...
----

[NOTE]
====
* If you set the `optional` flag value to `false` and the {servicebinding-title} is unable to find the target path, the Operator fails the annotations mapping.
* If the `optional` flag has no value set, the {servicebinding-title} considers the value as `false` by default and fails the annotations mapping.
====

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * /applications/connecting_applications_to_services/exposing-binding-data-from-a-service.adoc

[id="sbo-rbac-requirements_{context}"]
= RBAC requirements

[role="_abstract"]
To expose the backing service binding data using the {servicebinding-title}, you require certain Role-based access control (RBAC) permissions. Specify certain verbs under the `rules` field of the `ClusterRole` resource to grant the RBAC permissions for the backing service resources. When you define these `rules`, you allow the {servicebinding-title} to read the binding data of the backing service resources throughout the cluster. If the users do not have permissions to read binding data or modify application resource, the {servicebinding-title} prevents such users to bind services to application. Adhering to the RBAC requirements avoids unnecessary permission elevation for the user and prevents access to unauthorized services or applications.

The {servicebinding-title} performs requests against the Kubernetes API using a dedicated service account. By default, this account has permissions to bind services to workloads, both represented by the following standard Kubernetes or OpenShift objects:

* `Deployments`
* `DaemonSets`
* `ReplicaSets`
* `StatefulSets`
* `DeploymentConfigs`

The Operator service account is bound to an aggregated cluster role, allowing Operator providers or cluster administrators to enable binding custom service resources to workloads. To grant the required permissions within a `ClusterRole`, label it with the `servicebinding.io/controller` flag and set the flag value to `true`. The following example shows how to allow the {servicebinding-title} to `get`, `watch`, and `list` the custom resources (CRs) of Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator:

.Example: Enable binding to PostgreSQL database instances provisioned by Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1

----

This cluster role can be deployed during the installation of the backing service Operator.

[id="sbo-categories-of-exposable-binding-data_{context}"]
= Categories of exposable binding data

[role="_abstract"]
The {servicebinding-title} enables you to expose the binding data values from the backing service resources and custom resource definitions (CRDs).

This section provides examples to show how you can use the various categories of exposable binding data. You must modify these examples to suit your work environment and requirements.

[id="exposing-a-string-from-a-resource_{context}"]
== Exposing a string from a resource
The following example shows how to expose the string from the `metadata.name` field of the `PostgresCluster` custom resource (CR) as a username:

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1
kind: PostgresCluster
metadata:

----
<1> Binding `type` to be exposed with the `postgresql` value.

[id="exposing-an-entire-config-map-or-secret-that-is-referenced-from-a-resource_{context}"]
== Exposing an entire config map or secret that is referenced from a resource
The following examples show how to expose an entire secret through annotations:

.Example: Exposing an entire secret through annotations

The following example shows how to expose an entire config map through OLM descriptors:

.Example: Exposing an entire config map through OLM descriptors
[source,yaml]
----
- path: data.dbConfiguration
  x-descriptors:
  - urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:ConfigMap
  - service.binding
----

This example uses the `path` attribute with a `urn:alm:descriptor:io.kubernetes:ConfigMap` entry to indicate that the path points to the `ConfigMap` service resource.

If you intend to project all the values from a `ConfigMap` service resource, you must specify it as an attribute in the backing service CR. For example, if the attribute is part of the `.spec` section, you can create and use a `specDescriptors` array. Or, if the attribute is part of the `.status` section, you can create and use a `statusDescriptors` array.
// When the OLM descriptors are supported again, add this example.
