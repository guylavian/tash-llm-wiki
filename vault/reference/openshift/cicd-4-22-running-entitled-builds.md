# Using Red Hat subscriptions in builds

[id="running-entitled-builds"]
= Using Red Hat subscriptions in builds

[role="_abstract"]
Use the following sections to install Red Hat subscription content within OpenShift Container Platform builds.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
//* builds/running-entitled-builds.adoc

[id="builds-create-imagestreamtag_{context}"]
= Creating an image stream tag for the Red Hat Universal Base Image

To install {op-system-base-full} packages within a build, you can create an image stream tag to reference the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI).

To make the UBI available *in every project* in the cluster, add the image stream tag to the `openshift` namespace. Otherwise, to make it available *in a specific project*, add the image stream tag to that project.

Image stream tags grant access to the UBI by using the `registry.redhat.io` credentials that are present in the install pull secret, without exposing the pull secret to other users. This method is more convenient than requiring each developer to install pull secrets with `registry.redhat.io` credentials in each project.

.Procedure

* To create an `ImageStreamTag` resource in the `openshift` namespace, so it is available to developers in all projects, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag --source=docker registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest ubi9:latest -n openshift
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create an `ImageStreamTag` resource in the `openshift` namespace:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: ubi9
  namespace: openshift
spec:
  tags:
  - from:
      kind: DockerImage
      name: registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
    name: latest
    referencePolicy:
      type: Source
----
====

* To create an `ImageStreamTag` resource in a single project, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag --source=docker registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest ubi:latest
----

[id="builds-source-secrets-entitlements_{context}"]
= Adding subscription entitlements as a build secret

Builds that use Red Hat subscriptions to install content must include the entitlement keys as a build secret.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to {op-system-base-full} package repositories through your subscription. The entitlement secret to access these repositories is automatically created by the {insights-operator} when your cluster is subscribed.

* You must have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role or you have permission to access secrets in the `openshift-config-managed` project.

.Procedure

. Copy the entitlement secret from the `openshift-config-managed` namespace to the namespace of the build by entering the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF > secret-template.txt
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: etc-pki-entitlement
type: Opaque
data: {{ range \$key, \$value := .data }}
  {{ \$key }}: {{ \$value }} {{ end }}
EOF
$ oc get secret etc-pki-entitlement -n openshift-config-managed -o=go-template-file --template=secret-template.txt | oc apply -f -
----

. Add the etc-pki-entitlement secret as a build volume in the build configuration's Docker strategy:
+
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  dockerStrategy:
    from:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: ubi9:latest
    volumes:
    - name: etc-pki-entitlement
      mounts:
      - destinationPath: /etc/pki/entitlement
      source:
        type: Secret
        secret:
          secretName: etc-pki-entitlement
----

== Running builds with Subscription Manager

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
//* builds/running-entitled-builds.adoc

[id="builds-strategy-docker-entitled-subman_{context}"]
= Docker builds using Subscription Manager

Docker strategy builds can use `yum` or `dnf` to install additional {op-system-base-full} packages.

.Prerequisites

* The entitlement keys must be added as build strategy volumes.

.Procedure

* Use the following as an example Dockerfile to install content with the Subscription Manager:
+
--
[source,docker]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
RUN rm -rf /etc/rhsm-host <1>
RUN yum --enablerepo=codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms install \ <2>
    nss_wrapper \
    uid_wrapper -y && \
    yum clean all -y
RUN ln -s /run/secrets/rhsm /etc/rhsm-host <3>
----
<1> You must include the command to remove the `/etc/rhsm-host` directory and all its contents in your Dockerfile before executing any `yum` or `dnf` commands.
<2> Use the Red Hat Package Browser to find the correct repositories for your installed packages.
<3> You must restore the `/etc/rhsm-host` symbolic link to keep your image compatible with other Red Hat container images.

== Running builds with Red Hat Satellite subscriptions

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
//* builds/running-entitled-builds.adoc

[id="builds-source-input-satellite-config_{context}"]
= Adding Red Hat Satellite configurations to builds

Builds that use Red Hat Satellite to install content must provide appropriate configurations to obtain content from Satellite repositories.

.Prerequisites

* You must provide or create a `yum`-compatible repository configuration file that downloads content from your Satellite instance.
+
.Sample repository configuration
+
[source,terminal]
----
[test-<name>]
name=test-<number>
baseurl = https://satellite.../content/dist/rhel/server/7/7Server/x86_64/os
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
sslverify=0
sslclientkey = /etc/pki/entitlement/...-key.pem
sslclientcert = /etc/pki/entitlement/....pem
----

.Procedure

. Create a `ConfigMap` object containing the Satellite repository configuration file by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap yum-repos-d --from-file /path/to/satellite.repo
----

. Add the Satellite repository configuration and entitlement key as a build volumes:
+
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  dockerStrategy:
    from:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: ubi9:latest
    volumes:
    - name: yum-repos-d

----

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//* builds/running-entitled-builds.adoc

[id="builds-strategy-docker-entitled-satellite_{context}"]
= Docker builds using Red Hat Satellite subscriptions

Docker strategy builds can use Red Hat Satellite repositories to install subscription content.

.Prerequisites

* You have added the entitlement keys and Satellite repository configurations as build volumes.

.Procedure

* Use the following example to create a `Dockerfile` for installing content with Satellite:
+
[source,docker]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
RUN rm -rf /etc/rhsm-host # <1>
RUN yum --enablerepo=codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms install \ # <2>
    nss_wrapper \
    uid_wrapper -y && \
    yum clean all -y
RUN ln -s /run/secrets/rhsm /etc/rhsm-host # <3>
----
<1> You must include the command to remove the `/etc/rhsm-host` directory and all its contents in your Dockerfile before executing any `yum` or `dnf` commands.
<2> Contact your Satellite system administrator to find the correct repositories for the build's installed packages.
<3> You must restore the `/etc/rhsm-host` symbolic link to keep your image compatible with other Red Hat container images.

* How to use builds with Red Hat Satellite subscriptions and which certificate to use

// Beginning of "Running entitled builds with SharedSecret objects" section

// Tech Preview features are not included in ROSA and OSD. When this feature
// is GA, it should be evaluated for possible inclusion in the OSD and ROSA
// docs.

[id="builds-running-entitled-builds-with-sharedsecret-objects_{context}"]
= Running builds using SharedSecret objects

You can use a `SharedSecret` object to securely access the entitlement keys of a cluster in builds.

The `SharedSecret` object allows you to share and synchronize secrets across namespaces.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Shared Resource CSI Driver feature is now generally available in {builds-v2title} 1.1. This feature is now removed in OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 and later. To use this feature, ensure that you are using {builds-v2title} 1.1 or later.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set by using the feature gates. For more information, see Enabling features using feature gates.
* You must have permission to perform the following actions:
** Create build configs and start builds.
** Discover which `SharedSecret` CR instances are available by entering the `oc get sharedsecrets` command and getting a non-empty list back.
** Determine if the `builder` service account available to you in your namespace is allowed to use the given `SharedSecret` CR instance. In other words, you can run `oc adm policy who-can use <identifier of specific SharedSecret>` to see if the `builder` service account in your namespace is listed.

[NOTE]
====
If neither of the last two prerequisites in this list are met, establish, or ask someone to establish, the necessary role-based access control (RBAC) so that you can discover `SharedSecret` CR instances and enable service accounts to use `SharedSecret` CR instances.
====

.Procedure

. Use `oc apply` to create a `SharedSecret` object instance with the cluster's entitlement secret.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have cluster administrator permissions to create `SharedSecret` objects.
====
