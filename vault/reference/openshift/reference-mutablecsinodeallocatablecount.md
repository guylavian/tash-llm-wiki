# MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount

Make the `.spec.drivers[*].allocatable.count` field of a CSINode mutable.
Also, enable a CSIDriver field, `nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds`.

This allows periodic updates to a node's reported allocatable volume capacity,
preventing stateful pods from becoming stuck due to outdated information
that the kube-scheduler would otherwise rely upon.
