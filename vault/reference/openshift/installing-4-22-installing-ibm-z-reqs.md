# Installation requirements for {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title} infrastructure

[id="installing-ibm-z-reqs"]
= Installation requirements for {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title} infrastructure

Before you begin an installation on {ibm-z-name} infrastructure, be sure that your {ibm-z-name} environment meets the following installation requirements.

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.

[role="_abstract"]
You must specify the minimum required machines or hosts for your cluster so that your cluster remains stable if a node fails.

The smallest OpenShift Container Platform clusters require the following hosts:

|Hosts |Description

|One temporary bootstrap machine
|The cluster requires the bootstrap machine to deploy the OpenShift Container Platform cluster
on the three control plane machines. You can remove the bootstrap machine after
you install the cluster.

|Three control plane machines
|The control plane machines run the Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform services that form the control plane.

|At least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.
|The workloads requested by OpenShift Container Platform users run on the compute machines.

|===

[NOTE]
====
As an exception, you can run zero compute machines in a bare metal cluster that consists of three control plane machines only. This provides smaller, more resource efficient clusters for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production. Running one compute machine is not supported.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
To improve high availability of your cluster, distribute the control plane machines over different hypervisor instances on at least two physical machines.
To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for
these cluster machines.
====

The bootstrap and control plane machines must use {op-system-first} as the operating system. However, the compute machines can choose between {op-system-first}, {op-system-base-full} 8.6 and later.
The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines must use {op-system-first} as the operating system.

Note that {op-system} is based on {op-system-base-full} 9.8 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements.

1. One physical core (IFL) provides two logical cores (threads) when SMT-2 is enabled. The hypervisor can provide two or more vCPUs.
1. One CPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = CPUs.

2. OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.
3. As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use {op-system-base} compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of {op-system-base} 7 compute machines is deprecated and has been removed in OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later.

[NOTE]
====
For OpenShift Container Platform version 4.22, {op-system} is based on {op-system-base} version 9.8, which has the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:

* x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
* ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
* IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA
* s390x architecture requires z14 ISA

For more information, see Architectures ({op-system-base} documentation).
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You are required to use Azure virtual machines that have the `premiumIO` parameter set to `true`.
====

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in OpenShift Container Platform.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use memory ballooning in OpenShift Container Platform clusters. Memory ballooning can cause cluster-wide instabilities, service degradation, or other undefined behaviors.

* Control plane machines should have committed memory equal to or greater than the published minimum resource requirements for a cluster installation.

* Compute machines should have a minimum reservation equal to or greater than the published minimum resource requirements for a cluster installation.

These minimum CPU and memory requirements do not account for resources required by user workloads.

For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article Memory Ballooning and OpenShift.

1. When running OpenShift Container Platform on {ibm-z-name} without a hypervisor use the Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) to manage your machine.
2. The {op-system-base} KVM host in your environment must meet certain requirements to host the virtual machines that you plan for the OpenShift Container Platform environment. See Enabling virtualization on {ibm-z-name}.

[NOTE]
====
For detailed system requirements, see Linux on {ibm-z-name}/{ibm-linuxone-name} tested platforms (IBM Support).

== Hardware requirements

* The equivalent of six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFL), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* At least one network connection to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of {ibm-z-name}. However, you must adjust the capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure that there are sufficient resources for every OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

* Since the overall performance of the cluster can be impacted, the LPARs that are used to set up the OpenShift Container Platform clusters must provide sufficient compute capacity. In this context, LPAR weight management, entitlements, and CPU shares on the hypervisor level play an important role.

[id="csr-management_{context}"]
= Certificate signing requests management

[role="_abstract"]
On user-provisioned infrastructure, you must provide a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation when your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management.

The `kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The `machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.

[id="installation-network-user-infra_{context}"]
= Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

[role="_abstract"]
You must configure networking for all the {op-system-first} machines in `initramfs` during boot, so that they can fetch their Ignition config files.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure you enable the `disk.EnableUUID` parameter on all virtual machines in your cluster.
====

During the initial boot, the machines require an HTTP or HTTPS server to
establish a network connection to download their Ignition config files.

The machines are configured with static IP addresses. No DHCP server is required. Ensure that the machines have persistent IP addresses and hostnames.
During the initial boot, the machines require an IP address configuration that is set either through a DHCP server or statically by providing the required boot options. After a network connection is established, the machines download their Ignition config files from an HTTP or HTTPS server. The Ignition config files are then used to set the exact state of each machine. The Machine Config Operator completes more changes to the machines, such as the application of new certificates or keys, after installation.

[NOTE]
====
* Consider using a DHCP server for long-term management of the cluster machines. Ensure that the DHCP server is configured to provide persistent IP addresses, DNS server information, and hostnames to the cluster machines.

* If a DHCP service is not available for your user-provisioned infrastructure, you can instead provide the IP networking configuration and the address of the DNS server to the nodes at {op-system} install time. These can be passed as boot arguments if you are installing from an ISO image. See the _Installing {op-system} and starting the OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process_ section for more information about static IP provisioning and advanced networking options.
====

The Kubernetes API server must be able to resolve the node names of the cluster machines. If the API servers and worker nodes are in different zones, you can configure a default DNS search zone to allow the API server to resolve the node names. Another supported approach is to always refer to hosts by their fully-qualified domain names in both the node objects and all DNS requests.

[id="installation-host-names-dhcp-user-infra_{context}"]
== Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP

On {op-system-first} machines, the hostname is set through NetworkManager. By default, the machines obtain their hostname through DHCP. If the hostname is not provided by DHCP, set statically through kernel arguments, or another method, it is obtained through a reverse DNS lookup. Reverse DNS lookup occurs after the network has been initialized on a node and can take time to resolve. Other system services can start prior to this and detect the hostname as `localhost` or similar. You can avoid this by using DHCP to provide the hostname for each cluster node.

Additionally, setting the hostnames through DHCP can bypass any manual DNS record name configuration errors in environments that have a DNS split-horizon implementation.

[id="installation-network-connectivity-user-infra_{context}"]
== Network connectivity requirements

You must configure the network connectivity between machines to allow OpenShift Container Platform cluster components to communicate. Each machine must be able to resolve the hostnames of all other machines in the cluster.

This section provides details about the ports that are required.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In connected OpenShift Container Platform environments, all nodes are required to have internet access to pull images
for platform containers and provide telemetry data to Red Hat.
====

[NOTE]
====
In a {op-system-base} KVM environment the host must be configured to use bridged networking in libvirt or MacVTap to connect the network to the virtual machines. The virtual machines must have access to the network, which is attached to the {op-system-base} KVM host. Virtual Networks, for example network address translation (NAT), within KVM are not a supported configuration.

OpenShift Container Platform clusters are configured to use a public Network Time Protocol (NTP) server by default. If you want to use a local enterprise NTP server, or if your cluster is being deployed in a disconnected network, you can configure the cluster to use a specific time server. For more information, see the documentation for _Configuring chrony time service_.

If a DHCP server provides NTP server information, the chrony time service on the {op-system-first} machines read the information and can sync the clock with the NTP servers.

= User-provisioned DNS requirements

[role="_abstract"]
In OpenShift Container Platform deployments, you must ensure that cluster components meet certain DNS name resolution criteria for internal communication, certificate validation, and automated node discovery purposes.

The following is a list of required cluster components:

* The Kubernetes API
* The OpenShift Container Platform application wildcard
* The bootstrap and control plane machines
* The compute machines

Reverse DNS resolution is also required for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, and the control plane machines.

Reverse DNS resolution is also required for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records are used for name resolution and PTR records are used for reverse name resolution. The reverse records are important because {op-system-first} uses the reverse records to set the hostnames for all the nodes, unless the hostnames are provided by DHCP. Additionally, the reverse records are used to generate the certificate signing requests (CSR) that OpenShift Container Platform needs to operate.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to use a DHCP server to provide the hostnames to each cluster node. See the _DHCP recommendations for user-provisioned infrastructure_ section for more information.
====

The following DNS records are required for a user-provisioned OpenShift Container Platform cluster and they must be in place before installation. In each record, `<cluster_name>` is the cluster name and `<base_domain>` is the base domain that you specify in the `install-config.yaml` file. A complete DNS record takes the form: `<component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`.

.Required DNS records
[cols="1a,3a,5a",options="header"]
|===

|Component
|Record
|Description

.2+a|Kubernetes API
|`api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|A DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record, and a DNS PTR record, to identify the API load balancer. These records must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|`api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|A DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record, and a DNS PTR record, to internally identify the API load balancer. These records must be resolvable from all the nodes within the cluster.
[IMPORTANT]
====
The API server must be able to resolve the worker nodes by the hostnames
that are recorded in Kubernetes. If the API server cannot resolve the node
names, then proxied API calls can fail, and you cannot retrieve logs from pods.
====

|Routes
|`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|A wildcard DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record that refers to the application ingress load balancer. The application ingress load balancer targets the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods.
By default, the Ingress Controller pods run on compute nodes. In cluster topologies without dedicated compute nodes, such as two-node or three-node clusters, the control plane nodes also carry the worker label, so the Ingress pods are scheduled on the control plane nodes.
The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.
These records must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

For example, `console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>` is used as a wildcard route to the OpenShift Container Platform console.

|Bootstrap machine
|`bootstrap.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|A DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record, and a DNS PTR record, to identify the bootstrap
machine. These records must be resolvable by the nodes within the cluster.

|Control plane machines
|`<control_plane><n>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records and DNS PTR records to identify each machine
for the control plane nodes. These records must be resolvable by the nodes within the cluster.

|Compute machines
|`<compute><n>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records and DNS PTR records to identify each machine
for the worker nodes. These records must be resolvable by the nodes within the cluster.

|===

[NOTE]
====
In OpenShift Container Platform 4.4 and later, you do not need to specify etcd host and SRV records in your DNS configuration.
====

[TIP]
====
You can use the `dig` command to verify name and reverse name resolution. See the section on _Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure_ for detailed validation steps.

= Example DNS configuration for user-provisioned clusters

[role="_abstract"]
Reference the example DNS configurations to understand how A and PTR record configuration samples meet the DNS requirements for deploying OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure.

The DNS configuration examples provided here are for reference only and are not meant to provide advice for choosing one DNS solution over another.

In the examples, the cluster name is `ocp4` and the base domain is `example.com`.

[NOTE]
====
In a two-node cluster with fencing, the control plane machines are also schedulable worker nodes. The DNS configuration must therefore include only the two control plane nodes. If you later add compute machines, provide corresponding A and PTR records for them as in a standard user-provisioned installation.
====

The following example is a BIND zone file that shows sample DNS A records for name resolution in a user-provisioned cluster.

[NOTE]
====
In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

[id="installation-load-balancing-user-infra_{context}"]
= Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

[role="_abstract"]
Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, you must provision the API and application Ingress load balancing infrastructure. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, you can provision your own API and application ingress load balancing infrastructure to use in place of the default, internal load balancing solution. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers with a {op-system-base-full} instance, you must purchase the {op-system-base} subscription separately.
====

The load balancing infrastructure must meet the following requirements:

* API load balancer: Provides a common endpoint for users, both human and machine, to interact with and configure the platform. Configure the following conditions:

** Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
** A stateless load balancing algorithm. The options vary based on the load balancer implementation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not configure session persistence for an API load balancer. Configuring session persistence for a Kubernetes API server might cause performance issues from excess application traffic for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster and the Kubernetes API that runs inside the cluster.
====

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the API load balancers:

[cols="2,5,^2,^2,2",options="header"]
|===

|Port
|Back-end machines (pool members)
|Internal
|External
|Description

|`6443`
|Bootstrap and control plane. You remove the bootstrap machine from the load
balancer after the bootstrap machine initializes the cluster control plane. You
must configure the `/readyz` endpoint for the API server health check probe.
|X
|X
|Kubernetes API server

|`22623`
|Bootstrap and control plane. You remove the bootstrap machine from the load
balancer after the bootstrap machine initializes the cluster control plane.
|X
|
|Machine config server

|===

[NOTE]
====
The load balancer must be configured to take a maximum of 30 seconds from the
time the API server turns off the `/readyz` endpoint to the removal of the API
server instance from the pool. Within the time frame after `/readyz` returns an
error or becomes healthy, the endpoint must have been removed or added. Probing
every 5 or 10 seconds, with two successful requests to become healthy and three
to become unhealthy, are well-tested values.
====

* Application Ingress load balancer: Provides an ingress point for application traffic flowing in from outside the cluster. A working configuration for the Ingress router is required for an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Configure the following conditions:

** Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
** A connection-based or session-based persistence is recommended, based on the options available and types of applications that will be hosted on the platform.

[TIP]
====
If the true IP address of the client can be seen by the application Ingress load balancer, enabling source IP-based session persistence can improve performance for applications that use end-to-end TLS encryption.
====

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the load balancers:

.Application Ingress load balancer

[NOTE]
====
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.
