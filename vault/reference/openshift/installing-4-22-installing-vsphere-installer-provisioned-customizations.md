# Installing a cluster on vSphere with customizations

[id="installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations"]
= Installing a cluster on vSphere with customizations

In OpenShift Container Platform version , you can install a cluster on your
{vmw-first} instance by using installer-provisioned infrastructure with customizations, including network configuration options. In each, you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

By customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations.

You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation, and you can modify only `kubeProxy` configuration parameters in a running cluster.

[id="prerequisites_installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations"]
== Prerequisites

* You have completed the tasks in Preparing to install a cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure.
* You reviewed your {vmw-short} platform licenses. Red{nbsp}Hat does not place any restrictions on your {vmw-short} licenses, but some {vmw-short} infrastructure components require licensing.
* You reviewed details about the OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You provisioned persistent storage for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide `ReadWriteMany` access modes.
* The OpenShift Container Platform installer requires access to port 443 on the vCenter and ESXi hosts. You verified that port 443 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you confirmed with the administrator that port 443 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach vCenter and ESXi hosts on port 443 for the installation to succeed.
* If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.

[id="cluster-entitlements_{context}"]
= Internet access for OpenShift Container Platform

[role="_abstract"]
In OpenShift Container Platform , you require access to the internet to
install
obtain the images that are necessary to install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to perform the following actions:

* Access {cluster-manager-url} to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your cluster cannot have direct internet access, you can perform a restricted network installation on some types of infrastructure that you provision. During that process, you download the required content and use it to populate a mirror registry with the installation packages. With some installation types, the environment that you install your cluster in will not require internet access. Before you update the cluster, you update the content of the mirror registry.

[id="installation-vsphere-regions-zones_{context}"]
= VMware vSphere region and zone enablement

You can deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to multiple vSphere data centers. Each data center can run multiple clusters. This configuration reduces the risk of a hardware failure or network outage that can cause your cluster to fail. To enable regions and zones, you must define multiple failure domains for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The VMware vSphere region and zone enablement feature requires the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver as the default storage driver in the cluster. As a result, the feature is only available on a newly installed cluster.

For a cluster that was upgraded from a previous release, you must enable CSI automatic migration for the cluster. You can then configure multiple regions and zones for the upgraded cluster.
====

The default installation configuration deploys a cluster to a single vSphere data center. If you want to deploy a cluster to multiple vSphere data centers, you must create an installation configuration file that enables the region and zone feature.

The default `install-config.yaml` file includes `vcenters` and `failureDomains` fields, where you can specify multiple vSphere data centers and clusters for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster. You can use the default `failureDomains` from `install-config.yaml` if you want to install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster in a vSphere environment that consists of single data center.

The following list describes terms associated with defining zones and regions for your cluster:

* Failure domain: Establishes the relationships between a region and zone. You define a failure domain by using vCenter objects, such as a `datastore` object. A failure domain defines the vCenter location for OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes.
* Region: Specifies a vCenter data center. You define a region by using a tag from the  `openshift-region` tag category.
* Zone: Specifies a vCenter cluster. You define a zone by using a tag from the `openshift-zone` tag category.

[NOTE]
====
If you plan on specifying more than one failure domain in your `install-config.yaml` file, you must create tag categories, zone tags, and region tags in advance of creating the configuration file.
====

You must create a vCenter tag for each vCenter data center, which represents a region. Additionally, you must create a vCenter tag for each cluster than runs in a data center, which represents a zone. After you create the tags, you must attach each tag to their respective data centers and clusters.

The following table outlines an example of the relationship among regions, zones, and tags for a configuration with multiple vSphere data centers running in a single VMware vCenter.

[id="installation-vsphere-regions-zones-host-groups_{context}"]
= VMware vSphere host group enablement

When deploying an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to {vmw-first}, you can map your {vmw-short} host groups onto OpenShift Container Platform failure domains. This is useful if you are using a stretched cluster configuration, where ESXi hosts are grouped into host groups by physical location.

To enable this feature, you must meet the following requirements:

* You must arrange your ESXi hosts into host groups.
* You must create a vCenter tag in the `openshift-region` tag category for your cluster. After you create the tag, you must attach the tag to the cluster.
* You must create a vCenter tag in the `openshift-zone` tag category for each host group and then attach the correct tag to each ESXi host.
* You must define multiple failure domains for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster in the `install-config.yaml` file.
* You must grant the `Host.Inventory.EditCluster` privilege on the {vmw-short} vCenter cluster object.

Review the following key terms, which correspond to parameters in your `install-config.yaml` file that you must configure to enable this feature:

* Failure domain: Specifies the relationships between regions and zones in OpenShift Container Platform, and clusters and host groups in {vmw-short}. You define a failure domain by using vCenter objects, such as a `datastore` object. A failure domain defines the vCenter location for OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes.
* Region: Specifies a vCenter cluster. You define a region by using a tag from the `openshift-region` tag category.
* Zone: Specifies a vCenter host group. You define a zone by using a tag from the `openshift-zone` tag category.
* Region type: Specifies the `ComputeCluster` region type to enable this feature.
* Zone type: Specifies the `HostGroup` zone type to enable this feature.

= Creating the installation configuration file

[role="_abstract"]
You can customize the OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on
Amazon Web Services (AWS).
{gcp-first}.
{ibm-cloud-name}.
{rh-openstack-first}.
VMware vSphere.
Nutanix.
{ibm-power-vc-name}.
Microsoft Azure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not specify `windows`, `microsoft`, or other variants of these words in the `metadata.name` parameter of the `install-config.yaml` file. Specifying one of these words for the cluster name causes the installation program to generate an error message like the following example message:

[source,terminal]
----
The resource name 'windows-xxxx-identity' or a part of the name is a trademarked or reserved word.
----

Additionally, specifying `login` at the beginning of the name in the `metadata.name` parameter of the `install-config.yaml` file results in the generation of an error message. You can specify `login` in the middle or end of the name.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.
* You have the `imageContentSources` values that were generated during mirror registry creation.
* You have the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file that was created when you mirrored your registry.
* You have the location of the {op-system-first} image you download.
* You have the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file that was created when you mirrored your registry.
* You have obtained the contents of the certificate for your mirror registry.
* You have retrieved a {op-system-first} image and uploaded it to an accessible location.
* You have an Azure subscription ID and tenant ID.
* If you are installing the cluster using a service principal, you have its application ID and password.
* If you are installing the cluster using a system-assigned managed identity, you have enabled it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
* If you are installing the cluster using a user-assigned managed identity, you have met these prerequisites:
** You have its client ID.
** You have assigned it to the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
* You have verified that you have met the Nutanix networking requirements. For more information, see "Preparing to install on Nutanix".
* Configure a {gcp-short} account.

.Procedure

. Optional: If you have run the installation program on this computer before, and want to use an alternative service principal or managed identity, go to the `~/.azure/` directory and delete the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file.
+
Deleting this file prevents the installation program from automatically reusing subscription and authentication values from a previous installation.

. Create the `install-config.yaml` file.
+
.. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory>
----
* `<installation_directory>`: For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.
+
When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the `execute` permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version.
+
[NOTE]
=====
Always delete the `~/.powervs` directory to avoid reusing a stale configuration. Run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ rm -rf ~/.powervs
----
=====
+
.. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
+
... Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

[NOTE]
====
After you create the installation configuration file, you can modify the file to create a multiple vSphere data center environment. This means that you can deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to multiple vSphere data centers. For more information about creating this environment, see the section named _VMware vSphere region and zone enablement_.
====
+
... Select the default vCenter datastore to use.
+
[WARNING]
====
You can specify the path of any datastore that exists in a datastore cluster. By default, Storage Distributed Resource Scheduler (SDRS), which uses Storage vMotion, is automatically enabled for a datastore cluster. Red Hat does not support Storage vMotion, so you must disable Storage DRS to avoid data loss issues for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

You cannot specify more than one datastore path. If you must specify VMs across multiple datastores, use a `datastore` object to specify a failure domain in your cluster's `install-config.yaml` configuration file. For more information, see "VMware vSphere region and zone enablement".
====
+

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see Resolve reserved resource name errors in the Azure documentation.
====
+
+
... Paste the {cluster-manager-url-pull}.
The cluster name you enter must match the cluster name you specified when configuring the DNS records.
+
... Enter a name for your cluster. The name must be 14 or fewer characters long.

. Modify the `install-config.yaml` file. The AWS Outposts installation has the following limitations which require manual modification of the `install-config.yaml` file:
+
* Unlike AWS Regions, which offer near-infinite scale, AWS Outposts are limited by their provisioned capacity, EC2 family and generations, configured instance sizes, and availability of compute capacity that is not already consumed by other workloads. Therefore, when creating new OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you need to provide the supported instance type in the `compute.platform.aws.type` section in the configuration file.
* When deploying OpenShift Container Platform cluster with remote workers running in AWS Outposts, only one Availability Zone can be used for the compute instances - the Availability Zone in which the Outpost instance was created in. Therefore, when creating new OpenShift Container Platform cluster, it recommended to provide the relevant Availability Zone in the `compute.platform.aws.zones` section in the configuration file, in order to limit the compute instances to this Availability Zone.
* Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) gp3 volumes are not supported by the AWS Outposts service. This volume type is the default type used by the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Therefore, when creating new OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you must change the volume type in the `compute.platform.aws.rootVolume.type` section to gp2.
You will find more information about how to change these values below.

. Modify the `install-config.yaml` file. You can find more information about the available parameters in the "Installation configuration parameters" section.
.. Define the network and subnets for the VPC to install the cluster in under the parent `platform.gcp` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  gcp:
    network: <existing_vpc>
    controlPlaneSubnet: <control_plane_subnet>
    computeSubnet: <compute_subnet>
----
+
For the `platform.gcp.network` parameter, specify the name for the existing Google VPC. For the `platform.gcp.controlPlaneSubnet` and `platform.gcp.computeSubnet` parameters, specify the existing subnets to deploy the control plane machines and compute machines, respectively.
.. Define the network and subnets for the VNet to install the cluster under the `platform.azure` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
networkResourceGroupName: <vnet_resource_group>
virtualNetwork: <vnet>
controlPlaneSubnet: <control_plane_subnet>
computeSubnet: <compute_subnet>
----
+
where:
+
`<vnet_resource_group>`:: Specifies the resource group name that contains the existing virtual network (VNet).
`<vnet>`:: Specifies the existing virtual network name.
`<control_plane_subnet>`:: Specifies the existing subnet name to deploy the control plane machines.
`<compute_subnet>`:: Specifies the existing subnet name to deploy compute machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing a three-node cluster, be sure to set the `compute.replicas` parameter to `0`. This ensures that the cluster's control planes are schedulable. For more information, see "Installing a three-node cluster on {platform}".
====

. In the `install-config.yaml` file, set the value of `platform.openstack.clusterOSImage` to the image location or name. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  openstack:
      clusterOSImage: http://mirror.example.com/images/rhcos-43.81.201912131630.0-openstack.x86_64.qcow2.gz?sha256=ffebbd68e8a1f2a245ca19522c16c86f67f9ac8e4e0c1f0a812b068b16f7265d

====
Azure Firewall does not work seamlessly with Azure Public Load balancers. Thus, when using Azure Firewall for restricting internet access, the `publish` field in `install-config.yaml` should be set to `Internal`.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use the default value of `External`, your network must be able to access the public endpoint for {ibm-cloud-name} Internet Services (CIS). CIS is not enabled for Virtual Private Endpoints.
====

. Make any other modifications to the `install-config.yaml` file that you require.
+
For more information about the parameters, see "Installation configuration parameters".

. Optional: Update one or more of the default configuration parameters in the `install.config.yaml` file to customize the installation.
+
For more information about the parameters, see "Installation configuration parameters".
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing a three-node cluster, be sure to set the `compute.replicas` parameter to `0`. This ensures that cluster's control planes are schedulable. For more information, see "Installing a three-node cluster on {platform}".
====

. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
====
+
If previously not detected, the installation program creates an `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file and stores this file in the `~/.azure/` directory on your computer. This ensures that the installation program can load the profile when it is creating an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the target platform.

[id="installation-configure-proxy_{context}"]
= Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

[role="_abstract"]
Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new OpenShift Container Platform
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file.

[NOTE]
====
For bare-metal installations, if you do not assign node IP addresses from the range that is specified in the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr` field in the `install-config.yaml` file, you must include them in the `proxy.noProxy` field.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

* You have reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the `Proxy` object's `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is populated with the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration.

For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), {gcp-first}, Microsoft Azure, and {rh-openstack-first}, the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`).
====

.Procedure

. Edit your `install-config.yaml` file and add the proxy settings. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  noProxy: example.com
  noProxy: ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com,elasticloadbalancing.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com,s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
additionalTrustBundle: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle>
# ...
----
+
where:
+
`proxy.httpProxy`:: Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`.
`proxy.httpsProxy`:: Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
`proxy.noProxy`:: Specifies a comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
If you have added the Amazon `EC2`, `Elastic Load Balancing`, and `S3` VPC endpoints to your VPC, you must add these endpoints to the `noProxy` field.
You must include vCenter's IP address and the IP range that you use for its machines.
`additionalTrustBundle`:: If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named `user-ca-bundle` in the `openshift-config` namespace to hold the additional CA certificates. If you provide `additionalTrustBundle` and at least one proxy setting, the `Proxy` object is configured to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The Cluster Network Operator then creates a `trusted-ca-bundle` config map that merges the contents specified for the `trustedCA` parameter with the {op-system} trust bundle. The `additionalTrustBundle` field is required unless the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the {op-system} trust bundle.
`additionalTrustBundlePolicy`:: Specifies the policy that determines the configuration of the `Proxy` object to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map in the `trustedCA` field. The allowed values are `Proxyonly` and `Always`. Use `Proxyonly` to reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map only when `http/https` proxy is configured. Use `Always` to always reference the `user-ca-bundle` config map. The default value is `Proxyonly`. Optional parameter.
+
[NOTE]
====
The installation program does not support the proxy `readinessEndpoints` field.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
If the installation program times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the `wait-for` command of the installation program. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
----
====

. Save the file and reference it when installing OpenShift Container Platform.
+
The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named `cluster` that uses the proxy settings in the provided `install-config.yaml` file. If no proxy settings are provided, a `cluster` `Proxy` object is still created, but it will have a nil `spec`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.

[id='modifying-install-config-for-dual-stack-network_{context}']
= Deploying with dual-stack networking

For dual-stack networking in OpenShift Container Platform clusters, you can configure IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints for cluster nodes. To configure IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints for cluster nodes, edit the `machineNetwork`, `clusterNetwork`, and `serviceNetwork` configuration settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. Each setting must have two CIDR entries each. For a cluster with the IPv4 family as the primary address family, specify the IPv4 setting first. For a cluster with the IPv6 family as the primary address family, specify the IPv6 setting first.

[source,yaml]

[IMPORTANT]
====
On a bare-metal platform, if you specified an NMState configuration in the `networkConfig` section of your `install-config.yaml` file, add `interfaces.wait-ip: ipv4+ipv6` to the NMState YAML file to resolve an issue that prevents your cluster from deploying on a dual-stack network.

====

To provide an interface to the cluster for applications that use IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, configure IPv4 and IPv6 virtual IP (VIP) address endpoints for the Ingress VIP and API VIP services. To configure IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints, edit the `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` configuration settings in the `install-config.yaml` file . The `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` configuration settings use a list format. The order of the list indicates the primary and secondary VIP address for each service.

[source,yaml]

[id="configuring-vsphere-regions-zones_{context}"]
= Configuring regions and zones for a VMware vCenter

You can modify the default installation configuration file, so that you can deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to multiple vSphere data centers.

The default `install-config.yaml` file configuration from the previous release of OpenShift Container Platform is deprecated. You can continue to use the deprecated default configuration, but the `openshift-installer` will prompt you with a warning message that indicates the use of deprecated fields in the configuration file.

.Prerequisites
* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` installation configuration file.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must specify at least one failure domain for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, so that you can provision data center objects for your VMware vCenter server. Consider specifying multiple failure domains if you need to provision virtual machine nodes in different data centers, clusters, datastores, and other components. To enable regions and zones, you must define multiple failure domains for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
====
+
* You have installed the `govc` command line tool.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The example uses the `govc` command. The `govc` command is an open source command available from VMware; it is not available from Red{nbsp}Hat. The Red{nbsp}Hat support team does not maintain the `govc` command. Instructions for downloading and installing `govc` are found on the VMware documentation website.
====

.Procedure

. Create the `openshift-region` and `openshift-zone` vCenter tag categories by running the following commands:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you specify different names for the `openshift-region` and `openshift-zone` vCenter tag categories, the installation of the OpenShift Container Platform cluster fails.
====

= Configuring host groups for a VMware vCenter

You can modify the default installation configuration file to deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on a {vmw-first} stretched cluster, where ESXi hosts are grouped into host groups by physical location.

The default `install-config.yaml` file configuration from previous releases of OpenShift Container Platform is deprecated. Though you can still use it, the OpenShift Container Platform installer will display a warning message that indicates the use of deprecated fields in the configuration file.

.Prerequisites

* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` installation configuration file.
* You have arranged your ESXi hosts into host groups.
* You have granted the `Host.Inventory.EditCluster` privilege on the {vmw-short} vCenter cluster object.
* You have downloaded and installed the `govc` command line tool. Instructions can be found on the VMware documentation website. Note that `govc` is an open-source tool that is not maintained by the Red{nbsp}Hat support team.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable host group support, you must define multiple failure domains for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
====

.Procedure

. Create the `openshift-region` and `openshift-zone` vCenter tag categories by running the following commands:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you specify different names for the `openshift-region` and `openshift-zone` vCenter tag categories, the installation of the OpenShift Container Platform cluster fails.

. Create a region tag for the {vmw-short} cluster where you want to deploy your OpenShift Container Platform cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ govc tags.create -c <region_tag_category> <region_tag>
----

. Create a zone tag for each host group by entering the following command as needed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ govc tags.create -c <zone_tag_category> <zone_tag>
----

. Attach the region tag to the vCenter cluster object by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ govc tags.attach -c <region_tag_category> <region_tag_1> /<datacenter_1>/host/<cluster_1>
----

. Use zone tags to associate each ESXi host with its host group, by entering the following command for each ESXi host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ govc tags.attach -c <zone_tag_category> <zone_tag_for_host_group_1> /<datacenter_1>/host/<cluster_1>/<esxi_host_in_host_group_1>
----

= Network configuration phases

[role="_abstract"]
There are two phases prior to OpenShift Container Platform installation where you can customize the network configuration. Customize settings in the `install-config.yaml` file and in the Cluster Network Operator manifest across two configuration phases.

Phase 1:: You can customize the following network-related fields in the `install-config.yaml` file before you create the manifest files:
+
* `networking.networkType`
* `networking.clusterNetwork`
* `networking.serviceNetwork`
* `networking.machineNetwork`
* `nodeNetworking`
+
For more information, see "Installation configuration parameters".
+
[NOTE]
====
Set the `networking.machineNetwork` to match the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) where the preferred subnet is located.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The CIDR range `172.17.0.0/16` is reserved by `libVirt`. You cannot use any other CIDR range that overlaps with the `172.17.0.0/16` CIDR range for networks in your cluster.
====

Phase 2:: After creating the manifest files by running `openshift-install create manifests`, you can define a customized Cluster Network Operator manifest with only the fields you want to modify. You can use the manifest to specify an advanced network configuration.

During phase 2, you cannot override the values that you specified in phase 1 in the `install-config.yaml` file. However, you can customize the network plugin during phase 2.

// Specifying advanced network configuration
// Module included in the following assemblies:

[id="modifying-nwoperator-config-startup_{context}"]
= Specifying advanced network configuration

[role="_abstract"]
To integrate your OpenShift Container Platform cluster with your existing network environment, you can specify advanced network configuration in a manifest before you install the cluster. Advanced network configuration can be configured only during cluster installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Customizing your network configuration by modifying the OpenShift Container Platform manifest files created by the installation program is not supported. Applying a manifest file that you create, as in the following procedure, is supported.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have created the `install-config.yaml` file and completed any modifications to it.

.Procedure

. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
----
+
The `<installation_directory>` specifies the name of the directory that contains the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster.

. Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named `cluster-network-03-config.yml` in the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
----

. Specify the advanced network configuration for your cluster in the `cluster-network-03-config.yml` file, such as in the following example:
+
.Enable IPsec for the OVN-Kubernetes network provider
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetwork:
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      ipsecConfig:
        mode: Full
----

. Optional: Back up the `manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml` file. The
installation program consumes the `manifests/` directory when you create the
Ignition config files.

. Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machines and compute `MachineSets`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*.yaml openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*.yaml
----
+
Because you create and manage these resources yourself, you do not have
to initialize them.
+
* You can preserve the `MachineSet` files to create compute machines by using the machine API, but you must update references to them to match your environment.

// Specifying multiple subnets for your network

//
// * installing/installing_vsphere/ipi/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations.adoc

[id="nw-operator-vsphere-multiple-subnets_{context}"]
= Specifying multiple subnets for your network

Before you install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on a {vmw-short} host, you can specify multiple subnets for a networking implementation so that the {vmw-short} cloud controller manager (CCM) can select the appropriate subnet for a given networking situation. {vmw-short} can use the subnet for managing pods and services on your cluster.

For this configuration, you must specify internal and external Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) implementations in the {vmw-short} CCM configuration. Each CIDR implementation lists an IP address range that the CCM uses to decide what subnets interact with traffic from internal and external networks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Failure to configure internal and external CIDR implementations in the {vmw-short} CCM configuration can cause the {vmw-short} CCM to select the wrong subnet. This situation causes the following error:

----
ERROR Bootstrap failed to complete: timed out waiting for the condition
ERROR Failed to wait for bootstrapping to complete. This error usually happens when there is a problem with control plane hosts that prevents the control plane operators from creating the control plane.
----

This configuration can cause new nodes that associate with a `MachineSet` object with a single subnet to become unusable as each new node receives the `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized` taint. These situations can cause communication issues with the Kubernetes API server that can cause installation of the cluster to fail.
====

.Prerequisites

* You created Kubernetes manifest files for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

.Procedure

. From the directory where you store your OpenShift Container Platform cluster manifest files, open the `manifests/cluster-infrastructure-02-config.yml` manifest file.

. Add a `nodeNetworking` object to the file and specify internal and external network subnet CIDR implementations for the object.
+
[TIP]
====
For most networking situations, consider setting the standard multiple-subnet configuration. This configuration requires that you set the same IP address ranges in the `nodeNetworking.internal.networkSubnetCidr` and `nodeNetworking.external.networkSubnetCidr` parameters.

[id="nw-operator-cr_{context}"]
= Cluster Network Operator configuration

[role="_abstract"]
To manage cluster networking, configure the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) `Network` custom resource (CR) named `cluster` so the cluster uses the correct IP ranges and network plugin settings for reliable pod and service connectivity. Some settings and fields are inherited at the time of install or by the `default.Network.type` plugin, OVN-Kubernetes.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the `Network` API in the `Network.config.openshift.io` API group:

`clusterNetwork`:: IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.
`serviceNetwork`:: IP address pool for services.
//Installation no longer supports SDN, so excluding it from install docs here. Deleted in 4.17.

`defaultNetwork.type`:: Cluster network plugin. `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported plugin during installation.

// For the post installation assembly, no further content is provided.
[NOTE]
====
After cluster installation, you can only modify the `clusterNetwork` IP address range. The `serviceNetwork` range cannot be modified post-installation, either directly or by using the `ServiceCIDR` API.
====

You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the `defaultNetwork` object in the CNO object named `cluster`.

[id="nw-operator-cr-cno-object_{context}"]
== Cluster Network Operator configuration object

The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table:

.Cluster Network Operator configuration object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6a",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|The name of the CNO object. This name is always `cluster`.

|`spec.clusterNetwork`
|`array`
|A list specifying the blocks of IP addresses from which pod IP addresses are allocated and the subnet prefix length assigned to each individual node in the cluster. If you use dual-stack networking, specify IPv4 and IPv6 address families. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/19
    hostPrefix: 23
  - cidr: fd01::/48
    hostPrefix: 64
----

If you install a cluster on {aws-short} with dual-stack networking, the order of addresses must match the dual-stack configuration you selected. For example, if you specified the `DualStackIPv4Primary`, list the IPv4 address first.

|`spec.serviceNetwork`
|`array`
|A block of IP addresses for services. If you use dual-stack networking, specify IPv4 and IPv6 address families. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/14
  - fd02::/112
----

If you install a cluster on {aws-short} with dual-stack networking, the order of addresses must match the dual-stack configuration you selected. For example, if you specified the `DualStackIPv4Primary`, list the IPv4 address first.

This value is ready-only and inherited from the `Network.config.openshift.io` object named `cluster` during cluster installation.
You can customize this field only in the `install-config.yaml` file before you create the manifests. The value is read-only in the manifest file.

|`spec.defaultNetwork`
|`object`
|Configures the network plugin for the cluster network.

|`spec.additionalRoutingCapabilities.providers`
|`array`
|This setting enables a dynamic routing provider. The FRR routing capability provider is required for the route advertisement feature. The only supported value is `FRR`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For a cluster that needs to deploy objects across multiple networks, ensure that you specify the same value for the `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` parameter for each network type that is defined in the `install-config.yaml` file. Setting a different value for each `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` parameter can impact the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, where the plugin cannot effectively route object traffic among different nodes.

[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6a",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`mtu`
|`integer`
|
The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) overlay network. This is detected automatically based on the MTU of the primary network interface. You do not normally need to override the detected MTU.

If the auto-detected value is not what you expect it to be, confirm that the MTU on the primary network interface on your nodes is correct. You cannot use this option to change the MTU value of the primary network interface on the nodes.

If your cluster requires different MTU values for different nodes, you must set this value to `100` less than the lowest MTU value in your cluster. For example, if some nodes in your cluster have an MTU of `9001`, and some have an MTU of `1500`, you must set this value to `1400`.
The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) overlay network. This value is normally configured automatically.

|`genevePort`
|`integer`
|
The port to use for all Geneve packets. The default value is `6081`. This value cannot be changed after cluster installation.
The UDP port for the Geneve overlay network.

|`ipsecConfig`
|`object`
|
Specify a configuration object for customizing the IPsec configuration.
An object describing the IPsec mode for the cluster.

|`ipv4`
|`object`
|Specifies a configuration object for IPv4 settings.

|`ipv6`
|`object`
|Specifies a configuration object for IPv6 settings.

|`policyAuditConfig`
|`object`
|Specify a configuration object for customizing network policy audit logging. If unset, the defaults audit log settings are used.

|`routeAdvertisements`
|`string`
a|Specifies whether to advertise cluster network routes. The default value is `Disabled`.
--
- `Enabled`: Import routes to the cluster network and advertise cluster network routes as configured in `RouteAdvertisements` objects.
- `Disabled`: Do not import routes to the cluster network or advertise cluster network routes.
--

|`gatewayConfig`
|`object`
|Optional: Specify a configuration object for customizing how egress traffic is sent to the node gateway. Valid values are `Shared` and `Local`. The default value is `Shared`. In the default setting, the Open vSwitch (OVS) outputs traffic directly to the node IP interface. If you are using hardware offloading, Red Hat recommends to use the default `Shared` gateway mode to bypass the host routing plane. In the `Local` setting, it traverses the host network; consequently, it gets applied to the routing table of the host.

[NOTE]
====
While migrating egress traffic, you can expect some disruption to workloads and service traffic until the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) successfully rolls out the changes.

|`boolean`
|Set this field to `true` to send egress traffic from pods to the host networking stack.
For highly-specialized installations and applications that rely on manually configured routes in the kernel routing table, you might want to route egress traffic to the host networking stack.
By default, egress traffic is processed in OVN to exit the cluster and is not affected by specialized routes in the kernel routing table.
The default value is `false`.

This field has an interaction with the Open vSwitch hardware offloading feature.
If you set this field to `true`, you do not receive the performance benefits of the offloading because egress traffic is processed by the host networking stack.

|`ipForwarding`
|`object`
|You can control IP forwarding for all traffic on OVN-Kubernetes managed interfaces by using the `ipForwarding` specification in the `Network` resource. Specify `Restricted` to only allow IP forwarding for Kubernetes related traffic. Specify `Global` to allow forwarding of all IP traffic. For new installations, the default is `Restricted`. For updates to OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 or later, the default is `Global`.
[NOTE]
====
The default value of `Restricted` sets the IP forwarding to drop.
====

|`ipv4`
|`object`
|Optional: Specify an object to configure the internal OVN-Kubernetes masquerade address for host to service traffic for IPv4 addresses.

|`ipv6`
|`object`
|Optional: Specify an object to configure the internal OVN-Kubernetes masquerade address for host to service traffic for IPv6 addresses.

= Services for a user-managed load balancer

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure an OpenShift Container Platform cluster
on {rh-openstack-first}
to use a user-managed load balancer in place of the default load balancer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Configuring a user-managed load balancer depends on your vendor's load balancer.

The information and examples in this section are for guideline purposes only. Consult the vendor documentation for more specific information about the vendor's load balancer.
====

Red Hat supports the following services for a user-managed load balancer:

* Ingress Controller
* OpenShift API
* OpenShift MachineConfig API

You can choose whether you want to configure one or all of these services for a user-managed load balancer. Configuring only the Ingress Controller service is a common configuration option. To better understand each service, view the following diagrams:

.Example network workflow that shows an Ingress Controller operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment
image::external-load-balancer-default.png[An image that shows an example network workflow of an Ingress Controller operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment.]

.Example network workflow that shows an OpenShift API operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment
image::external-load-balancer-openshift-api.png[An image that shows an example network workflow of an OpenShift API operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment.]

.Example network workflow that shows an OpenShift `MachineConfig` API operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment
image::external-load-balancer-machine-config-api.png[An image that shows an example network workflow of an OpenShift `MachineConfig` API operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment.]

The following configuration options are supported for user-managed load balancers:

* Use a node selector to map the Ingress Controller to a specific set of nodes. You must assign a static IP address to each node in this set, or configure each node to receive the same IP address from the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Infrastructure nodes commonly receive this type of configuration.

* Target all IP addresses on a subnet. This configuration can reduce the effort required to maintain the load balancer, because you can create and destroy nodes within those networks without reconfiguring the load balancer targets. If you deploy your ingress pods by using a machine set on a smaller network, such as a `/27` or `/28`, you can simplify your load balancer targets.
+
[TIP]
====
You can list all IP addresses that exist in a network by checking the machine config pool's resources.
====

Before you configure a user-managed load balancer for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, consider the following information:

* For a front-end IP address, you can use the same IP address for the front-end IP address, the Ingress Controller load balancer, and API load balancer. Check the vendor's documentation for this capability.

* For a back-end IP address, ensure that an IP address for an OpenShift Container Platform control plane node does not change during the lifetime of the user-managed load balancer. You can achieve this by completing one of the following actions:
** Assign a static IP address to each control plane node.
** Configure each node to receive the same IP address from the DHCP every time the node requests a DHCP lease. Depending on the vendor, the DHCP lease might be in the form of an IP reservation or a static DHCP assignment.

* Manually define each node that runs the Ingress Controller in the user-managed load balancer for the Ingress Controller back-end service. For example, if the Ingress Controller moves to an undefined node, a connection outage can occur.

= Configuring a user-managed load balancer

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure an OpenShift Container Platform cluster
on {rh-openstack-first}
to use a user-managed load balancer in place of the default load balancer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you configure a user-managed load balancer, ensure that you read the "Services for a user-managed load balancer" section.
====

Read the following prerequisites that apply to the service that you want to configure for your user-managed load balancer.

[NOTE]
====
MetalLB, which runs on a cluster, functions as a user-managed load balancer.
====

.Prerequisites

The following list details OpenShift API prerequisites:

* You defined a front-end IP address.
* TCP ports 6443 and 22623 are exposed on the front-end IP address of your load balancer. Check the following items:
** Port 6443 provides access to the OpenShift API service.
** Port 22623 can provide ignition startup configurations to nodes.
* The front-end IP address and port 6443 are reachable by all users of your system with a location external to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* The front-end IP address and port 22623 are reachable only by OpenShift Container Platform nodes.
* The load balancer backend can communicate with OpenShift Container Platform control plane nodes on port 6443 and 22623.

The following list details Ingress Controller prerequisites:

* You defined a front-end IP address.
* TCP port 443 and port 80 are exposed on the front-end IP address of your load balancer.
* The front-end IP address, port 80 and port 443 are reachable by all users of your system with a location external to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* The front-end IP address, port 80 and port 443 are reachable by all nodes that operate in your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* The load balancer backend can communicate with OpenShift Container Platform nodes that run the Ingress Controller on ports 80, 443, and 1936.

The following list details prerequisites for health check URL specifications:

You can configure most load balancers by setting health check URLs that determine if a service is available or unavailable. OpenShift Container Platform provides these health checks for the OpenShift API, Machine Configuration API, and Ingress Controller backend services.

The following example shows a Kubernetes API health check specification for a backend service:

[source,terminal]
----
Path: HTTPS:6443/readyz
Healthy threshold: 2
Unhealthy threshold: 2
Timeout: 10
Interval: 10
----

The following example shows a Machine Config API health check specification for a backend service:

[source,terminal]
----
Path: HTTPS:22623/healthz
Healthy threshold: 2
Unhealthy threshold: 2
Timeout: 10
Interval: 10
----

The following example shows a Ingress Controller health check specification for a backend service:

[source,terminal]
----
Path: HTTP:1936/healthz/ready
Healthy threshold: 2
Unhealthy threshold: 2
Timeout: 5
Interval: 10
----

.Procedure

. Configure the HAProxy Ingress Controller, so that you can enable access to the cluster from your load balancer on ports 6443, 22623, 443, and 80. Depending on your needs, you can specify the IP address of a single subnet or IP addresses from multiple subnets in your HAProxy configuration.

= Deploying the cluster

[role="_abstract"]
To deploy your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can initialize installation by running the `openshift-install create cluster` command from the directory that contains the installation program. The installation program provisions infrastructure and completes cluster setup.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can run the `create cluster` command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
+
If the {op-system-first} image is available locally, the host running the installation program does not require internet access.
* You have an Azure subscription ID and tenant ID.
* You have the application ID and password of a service principal.
* If you are installing the cluster using a service principal, you have its application ID and password.
* If you are installing the cluster using a system-assigned managed identity, you have enabled it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
* If you are installing the cluster using a user-assigned managed identity, you have met these prerequisites:
** You have its client ID.
** You have assigned it to the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.
* Optional: Before you create the cluster, you configured an external load balancer in place of the default load balancer.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You do not need to specify API and Ingress static addresses for your installation program. If you choose this configuration, you must take additional actions to define network targets that accept an IP address from each referenced vSphere subnet. See the section "Configuring a user-managed load balancer".
====

.Procedure
. Remove any existing {gcp-short} credentials that do not use the service account key
for the {gcp-short} account that you configured for your cluster and that are stored in the
following locations:
** The `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON`, or `GCLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON`
environment variables
** The `~/.gcp/osServiceAccount.json` file
** The `gcloud cli` default credentials

. Optional: If you have run the installation program on this computer before, and want to use an alternative service principal, go to the `~/.azure/` directory and delete the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file.
+
Deleting this file prevents the installation program from automatically reusing subscription and authentication values from a previous installation.
. Optional: If you have run the installation program on this computer before, and want to use an alternative service principal or managed identity, go to the `~/.azure/` directory and delete the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file.
+
Deleting this file prevents the installation program from automatically reusing subscription and authentication values from a previous installation.
. Export the `OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_OS_IMAGE_OVERRIDE` variable to specify the location of the {op-system-first} image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_OS_IMAGE_OVERRIDE="<path_to_image>/rhcos-<image_version>-ibmcloud.x86_64.qcow2.gz"
----
. In the directory that contains the installation program, initialize the cluster deployment by running the following command:
* In the directory that contains the installation program, initialize the cluster deployment by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \
    --log-level=info
----
+
** For `<installation_directory>`, specify the
location of your customized `./install-config.yaml` file.
directory name to store the files that the installation program creates.
** To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or
`error` instead of `info`.

+
If the installation program cannot locate the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file from a previous installation, you are prompted for Azure subscription and authentication values.
. Enter the following Azure parameter values for your subscription:
** *azure subscription id*: Enter the subscription ID to use for the cluster.
** *azure tenant id*: Enter the tenant ID.
. Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the *azure service principal client id*:
** If you are using a service principal, enter its application ID.
** If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.
** If you are using a user-assigned managed identity, specify its client ID.
. Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the *azure service principal client secret*:
** If you are using a service principal, enter its password.
** If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.
** If you are using a user-assigned managed identity,leave this value blank.
+
[NOTE]
====
If previously not detected, the installation program creates an `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file and stores this file in the `~/.azure/` directory on your computer. This ensures that the installation program can load the profile when it is creating an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the target platform.
====

+
When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the `execute` permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version.

. Provide values at the prompts:

.. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.
====
.. Select *aws* as the platform to target.
.. If you do not have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) profile stored on your computer, enter the AWS access key ID and secret access key for the user that you configured to run the
installation program.
+
[NOTE]
====
The AWS access key ID and secret access key are stored in `~/.aws/credentials` in the home directory of the current user on the installation host. You are prompted for the credentials by the installation program if the credentials for the exported profile are not present in the file. Any credentials that you provide to the installation program are stored in the file.
====
.. Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
.. Select the base domain for the Route 53 service that you configured for your cluster.
.. Select *azure* as the platform to target.
+
If the installation program cannot locate the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file from a previous installation, you are prompted for Azure subscription and authentication values.
.. Specify the following Azure parameter values for your subscription and service principal:
*** *azure subscription id*: Enter the subscription ID to use for the cluster.
*** *azure tenant id*: Enter the tenant ID.
*** *azure service principal client id*: Enter its application ID.
*** *azure service principal client secret*: Enter its password.
.. Select the region to deploy the cluster to.
.. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds to the Azure DNS Zone that you created for your cluster.
.. Select *gcp* as the platform to target.
.. If you have not configured the service account key for your {gcp-short} account on
your host, you must obtain it from {gcp-short} and paste the contents of the file
or enter the absolute path to the file.
.. Select the project ID to provision the cluster in. The default value is
specified by the service account that you configured.
.. Select the region to deploy the cluster to.
.. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds
to the public DNS zone that you created for your cluster.
.. test
.. Select *openstack* as the platform to target.
.. Specify the {rh-openstack-first} external network name to use for installing the cluster.
.. Specify the Floating IP address to use for external access to the OpenShift API.
.. Specify the {rh-openstack} flavor with at least 16 GB RAM to use for control plane
and compute nodes.
.. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. All DNS records will be
sub-domains of this base and will also include the cluster name.
.. Select *vsphere* as the platform to target.
.. Specify the name of your vCenter instance.
.. Specify the user name and password for the vCenter account that has the required permissions to create the cluster.
+
The installation program connects to your vCenter instance.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Some VMware vCenter Single Sign-On (SSO) environments with Active Directory (AD) integration might primarily require you to use the traditional login method, which requires the `<domain>\` construct.

To ensure that vCenter account permission checks complete properly, consider using the User Principal Name (UPN) login method, such as `<username>@<fully_qualified_domainname>`.
====

.. Select the data center in your vCenter instance to connect to.
.. Select the default vCenter datastore to use.
+
[NOTE]
====
Datastore and cluster names cannot exceed 60 characters; therefore, ensure the combined string length does not exceed the 60 character limit.
====
.. Select the vCenter cluster to install the OpenShift Container Platform cluster in. The installation program uses the root resource pool of the vSphere cluster as the default resource pool.
.. Select the network in the vCenter instance that contains the virtual IP addresses and DNS records that you configured.
.. Enter the virtual IP address that you configured for control plane API access.
.. Enter the virtual IP address that you configured for cluster ingress.
.. Enter the base domain. This base domain must be the same one that you used in the DNS records that you configured.
.. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
The cluster name must be the same one that you used in the DNS records that you configured.
+
[NOTE]
====
Datastore and cluster names cannot exceed 60 characters; therefore, ensure the combined string length does not exceed the 60 character limit.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see
Resolve reserved resource name errors in the Azure documentation.
====
If you provide a name that is longer
than 6 characters, only the first 6 characters will be used in the infrastructure
ID that is generated from the cluster name.
.. Paste the {cluster-manager-url-pull}.
.. Paste the {cluster-manager-url-pull}.
* If you do not have a {cluster-manager-url-pull}, you can paste the pull secret another private registry.
* If you do not need the cluster to pull images from a private registry, you can paste `{"auths":{"fake":{"auth":"aWQ6cGFzcwo="}}}` as the pull secret.

+
[NOTE]
====
If previously not detected, the installation program creates an `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file and stores this file in the `~/.azure/` directory on your computer. This ensures that the installation program can load the profile when it is creating an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the target platform.
====

. Optional: Remove or disable the `AdministratorAccess` policy from the IAM
account that you used to install the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The elevated permissions provided by the `AdministratorAccess` policy are required only during installation.
====

. Optional: You can reduce the number of permissions for the service account that you used to install the cluster.
** If you assigned the `Owner` role to your service account, you can remove that role and replace it with the `Viewer` role.
** If you included the `Service Account Key Admin` role,
you can remove it.

.Verification

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the `kubeadmin` user.

* Credential information also outputs to `<installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
====
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for _Recovering from expired control plane certificates_ for more information.

* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

= Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
To log in to your cluster as the default system user, export the `kubeconfig` file. This configuration enables the CLI to authenticate and connect to the specific API server created during OpenShift Container Platform installation.

The `kubeconfig` file is specific to a cluster and is created during OpenShift Container Platform installation.

.Prerequisites
* You deployed an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the {oc-first}.
* Ensure the bootstrap process completed successfully.

.Procedure

. Export the `kubeadmin` credentials by running the following command:
+

= Image registry removed during installation

[role="_abstract"]
On platforms that do not provide shareable object storage, the OpenShift Image Registry Operator bootstraps itself as `Removed`. This allows `openshift-installer` to complete installations on these platform types.

After installation, you must edit the Image Registry Operator configuration to switch the `managementState` from `Removed` to `Managed`. When this has completed, you must configure storage.

= Image registry storage configuration

[role="_abstract"]
Amazon Web Services provides default storage, which means the Image Registry Operator is available after installation. However, if the Registry Operator cannot create an S3 bucket and automatically configure storage, you must manually configure registry storage.
[role="_abstract"]
The Image Registry Operator is not initially available for platforms that do not provide default storage. After installation, you must configure your registry to use storage so that the Registry Operator is made available.

Configure a persistent volume, which is required for production clusters. Where applicable, you can configure an empty directory as the storage location for non-production clusters.

You can also allow the image registry to use block storage types by using the `Recreate` rollout strategy during upgrades.

[id="registry-configuring-storage-vsphere_{context}"]
= Configuring registry storage for VMware vSphere

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, following installation you must configure your registry to use storage.

.Prerequisites

* Cluster administrator permissions.
* A cluster on VMware vSphere.
* Persistent storage provisioned for your cluster, such as {rh-storage-first}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
OpenShift Container Platform supports `ReadWriteOnce` access for image registry storage when you have only one replica. `ReadWriteOnce` access also requires that the registry uses the `Recreate` rollout strategy. To deploy an image registry that supports high availability with two or more replicas, `ReadWriteMany` access is required.
====
+
* Must have "100Gi" capacity.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testing shows issues with using the NFS server on RHEL as storage backend for
core services. This includes the OpenShift Container Registry and Quay,
Prometheus for monitoring storage, and Elasticsearch for logging storage.
Therefore, using RHEL NFS to back PVs used by core services is not recommended.

Other NFS implementations on the marketplace might not have these issues.
Contact the individual NFS implementation vendor for more information on any
testing that was possibly completed against these OpenShift Container Platform core
components.
====

.Procedure

. Change the `spec.storage.pvc` field in the `configs.imageregistry/cluster` resource.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you use shared storage, review your security settings to prevent outside access.
====

. Verify that you do not have a registry pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n openshift-image-registry -l docker-registry=default
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
No resourses found in openshift-image-registry namespace
----
+
[NOTE]
=====
If you do have a registry pod in your output, you do not need to continue with this procedure.
=====
. Check the registry configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
storage:
  pvc:
    claim:
----
+
Leave the `claim` field blank to allow the automatic creation of an `image-registry-storage` persistent volume claim (PVC). The PVC is generated based on the default storage class. However, be aware that the default storage class might provide ReadWriteOnce (RWO) volumes, such as a RADOS Block Device (RBD), which can cause issues when you replicate to more than one replica.

[id="installation-registry-storage-block-recreate-rollout_{context}"]
= Configuring block registry storage for VMware vSphere

[role="_abstract"]
To allow the image registry to use block storage types such as vSphere Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) during upgrades as a cluster administrator, you can use the `Recreate` rollout strategy.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Block storage volumes are supported but not recommended for use with image
registry on production clusters. An installation where the registry is
configured on block storage is not highly available because the registry cannot
have more than one replica.
====

.Procedure

. Enter the following command to set the image registry storage as a block storage type, patch the registry so that it uses the `Recreate` rollout strategy, and runs with only `1` replica:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch config.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"rolloutStrategy":"Recreate","replicas":1}}'

. Provision the persistent volume (PV) for the block storage device, and create a persistent volume claim (PVC) for that volume. The requested block volume uses the ReadWriteOnce (RWO) access mode.
.. Create a `pvc.yaml` file with the following contents to define a VMware vSphere `PersistentVolumeClaim` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: image-registry-storage
  namespace: openshift-image-registry
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Gi
----
+
where:
--
`metadata.name`:: Specifies a unique name that represents the `PersistentVolumeClaim` object.
`metadata.namespace`:: Specifies the `namespace` for the `PersistentVolumeClaim` object, which is `openshift-image-registry`.
`spec.accessModes`:: Specifies the access mode of the persistent volume claim. With `ReadWriteOnce`, the volume can be mounted with read and write permissions by a single node.
`spec.resources.requests.storage`:: Specifies the size of the persistent volume claim.
--

.. Enter the following command to create the `PersistentVolumeClaim` object from the file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f pvc.yaml -n openshift-image-registry
----

+
. Enter the following command to edit the registry configuration so that it references the correct PVC:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit config.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]

[id="cluster-telemetry_{context}"]
= Telemetry access for OpenShift Container Platform

[role="_abstract"]
To provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, the Telemetry service requires internet access. When connected, this service runs automatically by default and registers your cluster to {cluster-manager-url}.

After you confirm that your {cluster-manager-url} inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using {cluster-manager},use subscription watch to track your OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level. For more information about subscription watch, see "Data Gathered and Used by Red Hat's subscription services" in the _Additional resources_ section.

[id='configure-network-components-to-run-on-the-control-plane_{context}']
= Configuring network components to run on the control plane

You can configure networking components to run exclusively on the control plane nodes. By default, OpenShift Container Platform allows any node in the machine config pool to host the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address. However, some environments deploy compute nodes in separate subnets from the control plane nodes, which requires configuring the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address to run on the control plane nodes.

[NOTE]
====
You can scale the remote nodes by creating a compute machine set in a separate subnet.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When deploying remote nodes in separate subnets, you must place the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address exclusively with the control plane nodes.

.Procedure

. Change to the directory storing the `install-config.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd ~/clusterconfigs
----

. Switch to the `manifests` subdirectory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd manifests
----

. Create a file named `cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ touch cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml
----

. Open the `cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml` file in an editor and enter a custom resource (CR) that describes the Operator configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  name: 50-worker-fix-ipi-rwn
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    storage:
      files:
        - path: /etc/kubernetes/manifests/keepalived.yaml
          mode: 0644
          contents:
            source: data:,
----
+
This manifest places the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address on the control plane nodes. Additionally, this manifest deploys the following processes on the control plane nodes only:
+
* `openshift-ingress-operator`
+
* `keepalived`

. Save the `cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml` file.

. Create a `manifests/cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  nodePlacement:
    nodeSelector:
      matchLabels:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""
----

. Consider backing up the `manifests` directory. The installer deletes the `manifests/` directory when creating the cluster.

. Modify the `cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` manifest to make the control plane nodes schedulable by setting the `mastersSchedulable` field to `true`. Control plane nodes are not schedulable by default. For example:
+
----
$ sed -i "s;mastersSchedulable: false;mastersSchedulable: true;g" clusterconfigs/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If control plane nodes are not schedulable after completing this procedure, deploying the cluster will fail.
====

== Next steps

* Customize your cluster.
* If necessary, you can
Remote health reporting.
* Set up your registry and configure registry storage.
* Optional: View the events from the {vmw-short} Problem Detector Operator to determine if the cluster has permission or storage configuration issues.
