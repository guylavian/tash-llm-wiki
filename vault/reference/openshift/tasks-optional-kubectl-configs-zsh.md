# zsh auto-completion

The kubectl completion script for Zsh can be generated with the command `kubectl completion zsh`. Sourcing the completion script in your shell enables kubectl autocompletion.

To do so in all your shell sessions, add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```zsh
source <(kubectl completion zsh)
```

If you have an alias for kubectl, kubectl autocompletion will automatically work with it.

After reloading your shell, kubectl autocompletion should be working.

If you get an error like `2: command not found: compdef`, then add the following to the beginning of your `~/.zshrc` file:

```zsh
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```
