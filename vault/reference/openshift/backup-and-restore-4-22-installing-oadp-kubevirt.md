# Configuring the {oadp-full} with {VirtProductName}

[id="installing-oadp-kubevirt"]
= Configuring the {oadp-full} with {VirtProductName}

[role="_abstract"]
You can install the {oadp-first} with {VirtProductName} by installing the OADP Operator and configuring a backup location. Then, you can install the Data Protection Application.

Back up and restore virtual machines by using the {oadp-full}.

{oadp-full} with {VirtProductName} supports the following backup and restore storage options:

* Container Storage Interface (CSI) backups

* Container Storage Interface (CSI) backups with DataMover

The following storage options are excluded:

* File system backup and restore

* Volume snapshot backups and restores

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default software catalog sources and mirror the Operator catalog.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat only supports the combination of {oadp-short} versions 1.3.0 and later, and {VirtProductName} versions 4.14 and later.

{oadp-short} versions before 1.3.0 are not supported for back up and restore of {VirtProductName}.

= Installing and configuring {oadp-short} with {VirtProductName}

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can install the {oadp-first} with {VirtProductName} by installing the {oadp-short} Operator and configuring a backup location. You can then install the Data Protection Application.

To install the {oadp-short} Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default software catalog sources and mirror the Operator catalog.

[NOTE]
====
{oadp-full} with {VirtProductName} supports the following backup and restore storage options:

* Container Storage Interface (CSI) backups

* Container Storage Interface (CSI) backups with DataMover

The following storage options are excluded:

* File system backup and restore

* Volume snapshot backup and restore

The latest version of the {oadp-short} Operator installs Velero {velero-version}.
====

[WARNING]
====
Red Hat support is limited to only the following options:

* CSI backups

* CSI backups with DataMover.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Install the {oadp-short} Operator according to the instructions for your storage provider.

. Install the Data Protection Application (DPA) with the `kubevirt` and `openshift` {oadp-short} plug-ins.

. Back up virtual machines by creating a `Backup` custom resource (CR).
+
You restore the `Backup` CR by creating a `Restore` CR.

= Installing the Data Protection Application

[role="_abstract"]
You install the Data Protection Application (DPA) by creating an instance of the `DataProtectionApplication` API.

.Prerequisites

* You must install the OADP Operator.
* You must configure object storage as a backup location.
* If you use snapshots to back up PVs, your cloud provider must support either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.
* If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials, you must create a `Secret` with the default name, `{credentials}`.
* If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you must create two `Secrets`:

** `Secret` with a custom name for the backup location. You add this `Secret` to the `DataProtectionApplication` CR.
** `Secret` with another custom name for the snapshot location. You add this `Secret` to the `DataProtectionApplication` CR.

* If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you must create a `Secret` with the default name, `{credentials}`, which contains separate profiles for the backup and snapshot location credentials.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not want to specify backup or snapshot locations during the installation, you can create a default `Secret` with an empty `credentials-velero` file. If there is no default `Secret`, the installation will fail.
====

.Procedure

. Click *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators* and select the OADP Operator.
. Under *Provided APIs*, click *Create instance* in the *DataProtectionApplication* box.

. Click *YAML View* and update the parameters of the `DataProtectionApplication` manifest:

= Restoring a single VM from a backup of multiple VMs

[role="_abstract"]
If you have a backup containing multiple virtual machines (VMs), and you want to restore only one VM, you can use the `LabelSelectors` section in the `Restore` CR to select the VM to restore. To ensure that the persistent volume claim (PVC) attached to the VM is correctly restored, and the restored VM is not stuck in a `Provisioning` status, use both the `app: <vm_name>` and the `kubevirt.io/created-by` labels. To match the `kubevirt.io/created-by` label, use the UID of `DataVolume` of the VM.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* You have labeled the VMs that need to be backed up.
* You have a backup of multiple VMs.

.Procedure

. Before you take a backup of many VMs, ensure that the VMs are labeled by running the following command:

[id="oadp-configuring-client-burst-qps_{context}"]
= Configuring the DPA with client burst and QPS settings

[role="_abstract"]
The burst setting determines how many requests can be sent to the `velero` server before the limit is applied. After the burst limit is reached, the queries per second (QPS) setting determines how many additional requests can be sent per second.

You can set the burst and QPS values of the `velero` server by configuring the Data Protection Application (DPA) with the burst and QPS values. You can use the `dpa.configuration.velero.client-burst` and `dpa.configuration.velero.client-qps` fields of the DPA to set the burst and QPS values.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.

[id="oadp-configuring-node-agent-non-root_{context}"]
= Configuring the node agent as a non-root and non-privileged user

[role="_abstract"]
To enhance the node agent security, you can configure the {oadp-short} Operator node agent daemonset to run as a non-root and non-privileged user by using the `spec.configuration.velero.disableFsBackup` setting in the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) custom resource (CR).

By setting the `spec.configuration.velero.disableFsBackup` setting to `true`, the node agent security context sets the root file system to read-only and sets the `privileged` flag to `false`.

[NOTE]
====
Setting `spec.configuration.velero.disableFsBackup` to `true` enhances the node agent security by removing the need for privileged containers and enforcing a read-only root file system.

However, it also disables File System Backup (FSB) with Kopia. If your workloads rely on FSB for backing up volumes that do not support native snapshots, then you should evaluate whether the `disableFsBackup` configuration fits your use case.

= Configuring node agents and node labels

[role="_abstract"]
The Data Protection Application (DPA) uses the `nodeSelector` field to select which nodes can run the node agent. The `nodeSelector` field is the recommended form of node selection constraint.

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node/<node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/nodeAgent=""

[role="_abstract"]
Use the following guidelines to configure the node agent `loadAffinity` object in the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) custom resource (CR).

* Use the `spec.nodeagent.podConfig.nodeSelector` object for simple node matching.
* Use the `loadAffinity.nodeSelector` object without the `podConfig.nodeSelector` object for more complex scenarios.
* You can use both `podConfig.nodeSelector` and `loadAffinity.nodeSelector` objects, but the `loadAffinity` object must be equal or more restrictive as compared to the `podConfig` object. In this scenario, the `podConfig.nodeSelector` labels must be a subset of the labels used in the `loadAffinity.nodeSelector` object.
* You cannot use the `matchExpressions` and `matchLabels` fields if you have configured both `podConfig.nodeSelector` and `loadAffinity.nodeSelector` objects in the DPA.
* See the following example to configure both `podConfig.nodeSelector` and `loadAffinity.nodeSelector` objects in the DPA.

The range of per-node concurrent number is the same as the global concurrent number. If the configuration file contains a per-node concurrent number and a global concurrent number, the per-node concurrent number takes precedence.

= Configuring repository maintenance

[role="_abstract"]
{oadp-short} repository maintenance is a background job, you can configure it independently of the node agent pods. This means that you can schedule the repository maintenance pod on a node where the node agent is or is not running.

You can use the repository maintenance job affinity configurations in the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) custom resource (CR) only if you use Kopia as the backup repository.

You have the option to configure the load affinity at the global level affecting all repositories. Or you can configure the load affinity for each repository. You can also use a combination of global and per-repository configuration.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* You have configured the DPA CR.

.Procedure

* Configure the `loadAffinity` object in the DPA spec by using either one or both of the following methods:
** Global configuration: Configure load affinity for all repositories as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]

[id="oadp-configuring-velero-load-affinity_{context}"]
= Configuring Velero load affinity

[role="_abstract"]
With each {oadp-short} deployment, there is one Velero pod and its main purpose is to schedule Velero workloads. To schedule the Velero pod, you can use the `velero.podConfig.nodeSelector` and the `velero.loadAffinity` objects in the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) custom resource (CR) spec.

Use the `podConfig.nodeSelector` object to assign the Velero pod to specific nodes. You can also configure the `velero.loadAffinity` object for pod-level affinity and anti-affinity.

The OpenShift scheduler applies the rules and performs the scheduling of the Velero pod deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* You have configured the DPA CR.

.Procedure

* Configure the `velero.podConfig.nodeSelector` and the `velero.loadAffinity` objects in the DPA spec as shown in the following examples:

[id="oadp-configuring-priority-class_{context}"]
= Configuring a priority class for node agent and Velero pods

[role="_abstract"]
Configure a `priorityClassName` field for the node agent and Velero pods by editing the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) custom resource (CR). This helps you ensure that the Kubernetes scheduler prioritizes {oadp-short} pods during resource contention.

By setting a priority class, you ensure that critical {oadp-short} pods are scheduled first after events such as worker node outages, when user workloads might otherwise consume available resources.

.Prerequisites

* The {oadp-short} Operator is installed.
* A DPA CR is configured.
* A `PriorityClass` object is created in the cluster.

.Procedure

. In your DPA CR, configure the `priorityClassName` field for the node agent, Velero, or both, in the `podConfig` object as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: <dpa_name>
  namespace: openshift-adp

      uploaderType: kopia
      podConfig:
        priorityClassName: <priority_class_name>
    velero:
      podConfig:
        priorityClassName: <priority_class_name>
----
+
where:
`<priority_class_name>`:: Specifies the name of an existing `PriorityClass` to apply to the pods managed by this `podConfig` object. For example, `system-cluster-critical`.

. Apply the `DataProtectionApplication` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc apply -f <dpa_file_name>
----

.Verification

. Verify that the node agent daemon set pods have the correct priority class by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-adp -l name=node-agent -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{" "}{.spec.priorityClassName}{"\n"}{end}'
----

[id="oadp-configuring-imagepullpolicy_{context}"]
= Overriding the imagePullPolicy setting in the DPA

[role="_abstract"]
In {oadp-short} 1.4.0 or earlier, the Operator sets the `imagePullPolicy` field of the Velero and node agent pods to `Always` for all images.

In {oadp-short} 1.4.1 or later, the Operator first checks if each image has the `sha256` or `sha512` digest and sets the `imagePullPolicy` field accordingly:

* If the image has the digest, the Operator sets `imagePullPolicy` to `IfNotPresent`.
* If the image does not have the digest, the Operator sets `imagePullPolicy` to `Always`.

You can also override the `imagePullPolicy` field by using the `spec.imagePullPolicy` field in the Data Protection Application (DPA).

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.

.Procedure

* Configure the `spec.imagePullPolicy` field in the DPA as shown in the following example:
