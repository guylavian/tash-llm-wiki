# Distributing hosted cluster workloads

[id="hcp-distribute-workloads"]
= Distributing hosted cluster workloads

[role="_abstract"]
In {hcp} for OpenShift Container Platform, cluster management is separate from cluster workload. As you prepare your deployment, ensure you know how you want to distribute your hosted cluster workloads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use the management cluster for your workload. Workloads must not run on nodes where control planes run.

[id="hcp-node-labeling_{context}"]
= Node labeling for {hcp}

[role="_abstract"]
Before you get started with {hcp}, you must properly label nodes so that the pods of hosted clusters can be scheduled into infrastructure nodes.

Node labeling is also important for the following reasons:

* To ensure high availability and proper workload deployment. For example, to avoid having the control plane workload count toward your OpenShift Container Platform subscription, you can set the `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` label.
* To ensure that control plane workloads are separate from other workloads in the management cluster.
* To ensure that control plane workloads are configured at the correct multi-tenancy distribution level for your deployment. The distribution levels are as follows:

** Everything shared: Control planes for hosted clusters can run on any node that is designated for control planes.
** Nothing shared: Every control plane has its own dedicated nodes.

For more information about dedicating a node to a single hosted cluster, see "Labeling management cluster nodes".

[id="hcp-labels-taints_{context}"]
= Labeling management cluster nodes

[role="_abstract"]
Proper node labeling is a prerequisite to deploying {hcp}.

As a management cluster administrator, you use the following labels and taints in management cluster nodes to schedule a control plane workload:

* `hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane: true`: Use this label and taint to dedicate a node to running hosted control plane workloads. By setting a value of `true`, you avoid sharing the control plane nodes with other components, for example, the infrastructure components of the management cluster or any other mistakenly deployed workload.
* `hypershift.openshift.io/cluster: ${HostedControlPlane Namespace}`: Use this label and taint when you want to dedicate a node to a single hosted cluster.

Apply the following labels on the nodes that host control-plane pods:

* `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra`: Use this label to avoid having the control-plane workload count toward your subscription.
* `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`: Use this label on the management cluster nodes to deploy highly available clusters across failure domains. The zone might be a location, rack name, or the hostname of the node where the zone is set. For example, a management cluster has the following nodes: `worker-1a`, `worker-1b`, `worker-2a`, and `worker-2b`. The `worker-1a` and `worker-1b` nodes are in `rack1`, and the `worker-2a` and worker-2b nodes are in `rack2`. To use each rack as an availability zone, enter the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node/worker-1a node/worker-1b topology.kubernetes.io/zone=rack1
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node/worker-2a node/worker-2b topology.kubernetes.io/zone=rack2
----

Pods for a hosted cluster have tolerations, and the scheduler uses affinity rules to schedule them. Pods tolerate taints for `control-plane` and the `cluster` for the pods. The scheduler prioritizes the scheduling of pods into nodes that are labeled with `hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane` and `hypershift.openshift.io/cluster: ${HostedControlPlane Namespace}`.

For the `ControllerAvailabilityPolicy` option, use `HighlyAvailable`, which is the default value that the {hcp} command-line interface, `hcp`, deploys. When you use that option, you can schedule pods for each deployment within a hosted cluster across different failure domains by setting `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` as the topology key. Scheduling pods for a deployment within a hosted cluster across different failure domains is available only for highly available control planes.

.Procedure

* To enable a hosted cluster to require its pods to be scheduled into infrastructure nodes, set the `HostedCluster.spec.nodeSelector` specification, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
----
+
This way, {hcp} for each hosted cluster are eligible infrastructure node workloads, and you do not need to entitle the underlying OpenShift Container Platform nodes.

//
// * hosted_control_planes/hcp-prepare/hcp-distribute-workloads.adoc

[id="hcp-priority-classes_{context}"]
= Priority classes

[role="_abstract"]
Four built-in priority classes influence the priority and preemption of the hosted cluster pods.

You can create the pods in the management cluster in the following order from highest to lowest:

* `hypershift-operator`: HyperShift Operator pods.
* `hypershift-etcd`: Pods for etcd.
* `hypershift-api-critical`: Pods that are required for API calls and resource admission to succeed. These pods include pods such as `kube-apiserver`, aggregated API servers, and web hooks.
* `hypershift-control-plane`: Pods in the control plane that are not API-critical but still need elevated priority, such as the cluster version Operator.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * hosted_control_planes/hcp-prepare/hcp-distribute-workloads.adoc

[id="hcp-virt-taints-tolerations_{context}"]
= Custom taints and tolerations

[role="_abstract"]
By default, pods for a hosted cluster tolerate the `control-plane` and `cluster` taints. However, you can also use custom taints on nodes so that hosted clusters can tolerate those taints on a per-hosted-cluster basis by setting the `HostedCluster.spec.tolerations` specification.

.Example configuration
[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    tolerations:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: kubernetes.io/custom
      operator: Exists
----

You can also set tolerations on the hosted cluster while you create a cluster by using the `--tolerations` hcp CLI argument.

.Example CLI argument
[source,terminal]
----
--toleration="key=kubernetes.io/custom,operator=Exists,effect=NoSchedule"
----

For fine granular control of hosted cluster pod placement on a per-hosted-cluster basis, use custom tolerations with `nodeSelectors`. You can co-locate groups of hosted clusters and isolate them from other hosted clusters. You can also place hosted clusters in infra and control plane nodes.

Tolerations on the hosted cluster spread only to the pods of the control plane. To configure other pods that run on the management cluster and infrastructure-related pods, such as the pods to run virtual machines, you need to use a different process.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * hosted_control_planes/hcp-prepare/hcp-distribute-workloads.adoc
// * hosted_control_planes/hcp-networking.adoc

[id="hcp-isolation_{context}"]
= Control plane isolation

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {hcp} to isolate network traffic or control plane pods.

Each hosted control plane is assigned to run in a dedicated Kubernetes namespace. By default, the Kubernetes namespace denies all network traffic.

The following network traffic is allowed through the network policy that is enforced by the Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI):

* Ingress pod-to-pod communication in the same namespace (intra-tenant)
* Ingress on port 6443 to the hosted `kube-apiserver` pod for the tenant
* Metric scraping from the management cluster Kubernetes namespace with the `network.openshift.io/policy-group: monitoring` label is allowed for monitoring

[id="hcp-cp-pod-isolation_{context}"]
== Control plane pod isolation

In addition to network policies, each hosted control plane pod is run with the `restricted` security context constraint. This policy denies access to all host features and requires pods to be run with a unique identifier (UID) and with SELinux context that is allocated uniquely to each namespace that hosts a customer control plane.

The policy ensures the following constraints:

* Pods cannot run as privileged.
* Pods cannot mount host directory volumes.
* Pods must run as a user in a pre-allocated range of UIDs.
* Pods must run with a pre-allocated Multi-Category Security (MCS) label.
* Pods cannot access the host network namespace.
* Pods cannot expose host network ports.
* Pods cannot access the host PID namespace.
* By default, pods drop the following Linux capabilities: `KILL`, `MKNOD`, `SETUID`, and `SETGID`.

The management components, such as `kubelet` and `crio`, on each management cluster worker node are protected by an SELinux label that is not accessible to the SELinux context for pods that support {hcp}.

The following SELinux labels are used for key processes and sockets:

`kubelet`:: `system_u:system_r:unconfined_service_t:s0`
`crio`:: `system_u:system_r:container_runtime_t:s0`
`crio.sock`:: `system_u:object_r:container_var_run_t:s0`
`<example user container processes>`:: `system_u:system_r:container_t:s0:c14,c24`

To achieve physical or virtual machine (VM) isolation, you need to use a "shared-nothing" approach, where each control plane has its own dedicated node. Nodes for a specific hosted cluster are tainted and labeled with a specific `hypershift.openshift.io/hosted-cluster` value. Security involves the use of a network policy and physical network access control lists (ACLs) across hosted clusters.
