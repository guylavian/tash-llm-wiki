# Connecting service meshes

[id="ossm-federation"]
= Connecting service meshes

_Federation_ is a deployment model that lets you share services and workloads between separate meshes managed in distinct administrative domains.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise the assembly.

This module included in the following assemblies:
- ossm-federation.adoc

[id="ossm-federation-overview_{context}"]
= Federation overview

Federation is a set of features that let you connect services between separate meshes, allowing the use of {SMProductShortName} features such as authentication, authorization, and traffic management across multiple, distinct administrative domains.

Implementing a federated mesh lets you run, manage, and observe a single service mesh running across multiple OpenShift clusters. {SMProductName} federation takes an opinionated approach to a multi-cluster implementation of Service Mesh that assumes _minimal_ trust between meshes.

Service Mesh federation assumes that each mesh is managed individually and retains its own administrator. The default behavior is that no communication is permitted and no information is shared between meshes. The sharing of information between meshes is on an explicit opt-in basis. Nothing is shared in a federated mesh unless it has been configured for sharing. Support functions such as certificate generation, metrics and trace collection remain local in their respective meshes.

You configure the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` on each service mesh to create ingress and egress gateways specifically for the federation, and to specify the trust domain for the mesh.

Federation also involves the creation of additional federation files. The following resources are used to configure the federation between two or more meshes.

* A *ServiceMeshPeer* resource declares the federation between a pair of service meshes.

* An *ExportedServiceSet* resource declares that one or more services from the mesh are available for use by a peer mesh.

* An *ImportedServiceSet* resource declares which services exported by a peer mesh will be imported into the mesh.

* service_mesh/v2x/ossm-federation.adoc

[id="ossm-federation-features_{context}"]
= Federation features

[role="_abstract"]
Features of the {SMProductName} federated approach to joining meshes include the following:

* Supports common root certificates for each mesh.
* Supports different root certificates for each mesh.
//* Supports rotating any mesh’s intermediate certificate while preserving the federation connection.
* Mesh administrators must manually configure certificate chains, service discovery endpoints, trust domains, etc for meshes outside of the Federated mesh.
* Only export/import the services that you want to share between meshes.
** Defaults to not sharing information about deployed workloads with other meshes in the federation. A service can be *exported* to make it visible to other meshes and allow requests from workloads outside of its own mesh.
** A service that has been exported can be *imported* to another mesh, enabling workloads on that mesh to send requests to the imported service.
* Encrypts communication between meshes at all times.
//* Supports configuring failover from a service that is locally deployed to a service that is deployed in another mesh in the federation.
* Supports configuring load balancing across workloads deployed locally and workloads that are deployed in another mesh in the federation.

When a mesh is joined to another mesh it can do the following:

* Provide trust details about itself to the federated mesh.
* Discover trust details about the federated mesh.
* Provide information to the federated mesh about its own exported services.
* Discover information about services exported by the federated mesh.

[id="ossm-federation-security_{context}"]
= Federation security

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh federation takes an opinionated approach to a multi-cluster implementation of Service Mesh that assumes minimal trust between meshes. Data security is built in as part of the federation features.

* Each mesh is considered to be a unique tenant, with a unique administration.
* You create a unique trust domain for each mesh in the federation.
* Traffic between the federated meshes is automatically encrypted using mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS).
* The Kiali graph only displays your mesh and services that you have imported. You cannot see the other mesh or services that have not been imported into your mesh.

This module included in the following assemblies:
* service_mesh/v2x/ossm-federation.adoc

[id="ossm-federation-limitations_{context}"]
= Federation limitations

The {SMProductName} federated approach to joining meshes has the following limitations:

* Federation of meshes is not supported on OpenShift Dedicated.

This module included in the following assemblies:
* service_mesh/v2x/ossm-federation.adoc

[id="ossm-federation-prerequisites_{context}"]
= Federation prerequisites

The {SMProductName} federated approach to joining meshes has the following prerequisites:

* Two or more OpenShift Container Platform 4.6 or above clusters.
* Federation was introduced in {SMProductName} 2.1 or later. You must have the {SMProductName} 2.1 or later Operator installed on each mesh that you want to federate.
* You must have a version 2.1 or later `ServiceMeshControlPlane` deployed on each mesh that you want to federate.
* You must configure the load balancers supporting the services associated with the federation gateways to support raw TLS traffic. Federation traffic consists of HTTPS for discovery and raw encrypted TCP for service traffic.
* Services that you want to expose to another mesh should be deployed before you can export and import them. However, this is not a strict requirement. You can specify service names that do not yet exist for export/import. When you deploy the services named in the `ExportedServiceSet` and `ImportedServiceSet` they will be automatically made available for export/import.

[id="ossm-federation-planning_{context}"]
= Planning your mesh federation

Before you start configuring your mesh federation, you should take some time to plan your implementation.

* How many meshes do you plan to join in a federation? You probably want to start with a limited number of meshes, perhaps two or three.
* What naming convention do you plan to use for each mesh? Having a pre-defined naming convention will help with configuration and troubleshooting. The examples in this documentation use different colors for each mesh. You should decide on a naming convention that will help you determine who owns and manages each mesh, as well as the following federation resources:
** Cluster names
** Cluster network names
** Mesh names and namespaces
** Federation ingress gateways
** Federation egress gateways
** Security trust domains
+
[NOTE]
====
Each mesh in the federation must have its own unique trust domain.
====
+
* Which services from each mesh do you plan to export to the federated mesh? Each service can be exported individually, or you can specify labels or use wildcards.
** Do you want to use aliases for the service namespaces?
** Do you want to use aliases for the exported services?
* Which exported services does each mesh plan to import? Each mesh only imports the services that it needs.
** Do you want to use aliases for the imported services?

[id="ossm-federation-across-clusters_{context}"]
= Mesh federation across clusters

To connect one instance of the OpenShift Service Mesh with one running in a different cluster, the procedure is not much different as when connecting two meshes deployed in the same cluster. However, the ingress gateway of one mesh must be reachable from the other mesh. One way of ensuring this is to configure the gateway service as a `LoadBalancer` service if the cluster supports this type of service.

The service must be exposed through a load balancer that operates at Layer4 of the OSI model.

== Exposing the federation ingress on clusters running on bare metal
If the cluster runs on bare metal and fully supports `LoadBalancer` services, the IP address found in the `.status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip` field of the ingress gateway `Service` object should be specified as one of the entries in the `.spec.remote.addresses` field of the `ServiceMeshPeer` object.

If the cluster does not support `LoadBalancer` services, using a `NodePort` service could be an option if the nodes are accessible from the cluster running the other mesh. In the `ServiceMeshPeer` object, specify the IP addresses of the nodes in the `.spec.remote.addresses` field and the service's node ports in the `.spec.remote.discoveryPort` and `.spec.remote.servicePort` fields.

== Exposing the federation ingress on clusters running on {ibm-power-title} and {ibm-z-title}
If the cluster runs on {ibm-power-name} or {ibm-z-name} infrastructure and fully supports `LoadBalancer` services, the IP address found in the `.status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip` field of the ingress gateway `Service` object should be specified as one of the entries in the `.spec.remote.addresses` field of the `ServiceMeshPeer` object.

If the cluster does not support `LoadBalancer` services, using a `NodePort` service could be an option if the nodes are accessible from the cluster running the other mesh. In the `ServiceMeshPeer` object, specify the IP addresses of the nodes in the `.spec.remote.addresses` field and the service's node ports in the `.spec.remote.discoveryPort` and `.spec.remote.servicePort` fields.

== Exposing the federation ingress on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
By default, LoadBalancer services in clusters running on AWS do not support L4 load balancing. In order for {SMProductName} federation to operate correctly, the following annotation must be added to the ingress gateway service:

service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: nlb

The Fully Qualified Domain Name found in the `.status.loadBalancer.ingress.hostname` field of the ingress gateway `Service` object should be specified as one of the entries in the `.spec.remote.addresses` field of the `ServiceMeshPeer` object.

== Exposing the federation ingress on Azure
On Microsoft Azure, merely setting the service type to `LoadBalancer` suffices for mesh federation to operate correctly.

The IP address found in the `.status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip` field of the ingress gateway `Service` object should be specified as one of the entries in the `.spec.remote.addresses` field of the `ServiceMeshPeer` object.

== Exposing the federation ingress on {gcp-first}
On {gcp-full}, merely setting the service type to `LoadBalancer` suffices for mesh federation to operate correctly.

The IP address found in the `.status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip` field of the ingress gateway `Service` object should be specified as one of the entries in the `.spec.remote.addresses` field of the `ServiceMeshPeer` object.

[id="ossm-federation-config-smcp_{context}"]
= Configuring a {SMProductShortName} control plane for federation

Before a mesh can be federated, you must configure the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` for mesh federation. Because all meshes that are members of the federation are equal, and each mesh is managed independently, you must configure the SMCP for _each_ mesh that will participate in the federation.

In the following example, the administrator for the `red-mesh` is configuring the SMCP for federation with both the `green-mesh` and the `blue-mesh`.

== Understanding federation gateways

You use a *gateway* to manage inbound and outbound traffic for your mesh, letting you specify which traffic you want to enter or leave the mesh.

You use ingress and egress gateways to manage traffic entering and leaving the service mesh (North-South traffic). When you create a federated mesh, you create additional ingress/egress gateways, to facilitate service discovery between federated meshes, communication between federated meshes, and to manage traffic flow between service meshes (East-West traffic).

To avoid naming conflicts between meshes, you must create separate egress and ingress gateways for each mesh. For example, `red-mesh` would have separate egress gateways for traffic going to `green-mesh` and `blue-mesh`.

= Joining a federated mesh

You declare the federation between two meshes by creating a `ServiceMeshPeer` resource. The `ServiceMeshPeer` resource defines the federation between two meshes, and you use it to configure discovery for the peer mesh, access to the peer mesh, and certificates used to validate the other mesh’s clients.

image::ossm-federated-mesh.png[Service Mesh federated mesh peers illustration]

Meshes are federated on a one-to-one basis, so each pair of peers requires a pair of `ServiceMeshPeer` resources specifying the federation connection to the other service mesh. For example, federating two meshes named `red` and `green` would require two `ServiceMeshPeer` files.

. On red-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the green mesh.
. On green-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the red mesh.

Federating three meshes named `red`, `blue`, and `green` would require six `ServiceMeshPeer` files.

. On red-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the green mesh.
. On red-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the blue mesh.
. On green-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the red mesh.
. On green-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the blue mesh.
. On blue-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the red mesh.
. On blue-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the green mesh.

Configuration in the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource includes the following:

* The address of the other mesh’s ingress gateway, which is used for discovery and service requests.
* The names of the local ingress and egress gateways that is used for interactions with the specified peer mesh.
* The client ID used by the other mesh when sending requests to this mesh.
* The trust domain used by the other mesh.
* The name of a `ConfigMap` containing a root certificate that is used to validate client certificates in the trust domain used by the other mesh.

In the following example, the administrator for the `red-mesh` is configuring federation with the `green-mesh`.

.Prerequisites

* Two or more OpenShift Container Platform 4.6 or above clusters.
* The clusters must already be networked.
* The load balancers supporting the services associated with the federation gateways must be configured to support raw TLS traffic.
* Each cluster must have a version 2.1 or later `ServiceMeshControlPlane` configured to support federation deployed.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure from the Console
This is conjecture about what the flow might look like…

Follow this procedure to create a `ServiceMeshPeer` resource from the console. This example shows the `red-mesh` creating a peer resource for the `green-mesh`.

. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.
. Navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Click the *Project* menu and select the project where you installed the control plane for the mesh that is creating the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource. For example, `red-mesh-system`.
. Click the {SMProductName} Operator, then click *Istio Service Mesh ServiceMeshPeer*.
. On the *Istio Service Mesh ServiceMeshPeer* tab, click *Create ServiceMeshPeer*.
. On the *Create ServiceMeshPeer* page, click *YAML* to modify your configuration.
. Modify the default configuration with values for the mesh federation between the peers.
. Click *Create*. The Operator creates the mesh peer based on your configuration parameters.
. To verify the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource was created, click the *Istio Service Mesh ServiceMeshPeer* tab.
.. Click the name of the new `ServiceMeshPeer`, for example, `green-mesh`.
.. Click the *Resources* tab to see the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource the Operator created and configured.

= Exporting a service from a federated mesh

Exporting services allows a mesh to share one or more of its services with another member of the federated mesh.

image::ossm-federation-export-service.png[Service Mesh federation exporting service illustration]

You use an `ExportedServiceSet` resource to declare the services from one mesh that you are making available to another peer in the federated mesh. You must explicitly declare each service to be shared with a peer.

* You can select services by namespace or name.
* You can use wildcards to select services; for example, to export all the services in a namespace.
* You can export services using an alias. For example, you can export the `foo/bar` service as `custom-ns/bar`.
// Need non foo/bar example above
* You can only export services that are visible to the mesh’s system namespace. For example, a service in another namespace with a `networking.istio.io/exportTo` label set to ‘.’ would not be a candidate for export.
* For exported services, their target services will only see traffic from the ingress gateway, not the original requestor (that is, they won’t see the client ID of either the other mesh’s egress gateway or the workload originating the request)

The following example is for services that `red-mesh` is exporting to `green-mesh`.

= Creating an ExportedServiceSet

You create an `ExportedServiceSet` resource to explicitly declare the services that you want to be available to a mesh peer.

Services are exported as `<export-name>.<export-namespace>.svc.<ServiceMeshPeer.name>-exports.local` and will automatically route to the target service.  This is the name by which the exported service is known in the exporting mesh. When the ingress gateway receives a request destined for this name, it will be routed to the actual service being exported. For example, if a service named `ratings.red-mesh-bookinfo` is exported to `green-mesh` as `ratings.bookinfo`, the service will be exported under the name `ratings.bookinfo.svc.green-mesh-exports.local`, and traffic received by the ingress gateway for that hostname will be routed to the `ratings.red-mesh-bookinfo` service.

[NOTE]
====
When you set the `importAsLocal` parameter to `true` to aggregate the remote endpoint with local services, you must use an alias for the service. When you set the parameter `false`, no alias is required.
====

= Importing a service into a federated mesh

Importing services lets you explicitly specify which services exported from another mesh should be accessible within your service mesh.

image::ossm-federation-import-service.png[Service Mesh federation importing service illustration]

You use an `ImportedServiceSet` resource to select services for import. Only services exported by a mesh peer and explicitly imported are available to the mesh. Services that you do not explicitly import are not made available within the mesh.

* You can select services by namespace or name.
* You can use wildcards to select services, for example, to import all the services that were exported to the namespace.
* You can select services for export using a label selector, which may be global to the mesh, or scoped to a specific member namespace.
* You can import services using an alias. For example, you can import the `custom-ns/bar` service as `other-mesh/bar`.
// Need non foo/bar example above
* You can specify a custom domain suffix, which will be appended to the `name.namespace` of an imported service for its fully qualified domain name; for example, `bar.other-mesh.imported.local`.

The following example is for the `green-mesh` importing a service that was exported by `red-mesh`.

= Creating an ImportedServiceSet

You create an `ImportedServiceSet` resource to explicitly declare the services that you want to import into your mesh.

Services are imported with the name `<exported-name>.<exported-namespace>.svc.<ServiceMeshPeer.name>.remote` which is a "hidden" service, visible only within the egress gateway namespace and is associated with the exported service's hostname. The service will be available locally as `<export-name>.<export-namespace>.<domainSuffix>`, where `domainSuffix` is `svc.<ServiceMeshPeer.name>-imports.local` by default, unless `importAsLocal` is set to `true`, in which case `domainSuffix` is `svc.cluster.local`.  If `importAsLocal` is set to `false`, the domain suffix in the import rule will be applied.  You can treat the local import just like any other service in the mesh. It automatically routes through the egress gateway, where it is redirected to the exported service's remote name.

.Prerequisites

* The cluster and `ServiceMeshControlPlane` have been configured for mesh federation.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.
. Navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Click the *Project* menu and select the project where you installed the {SMProductShortName} control plane for the mesh you want to import services into. For example, `green-mesh-system`.
. Click the {SMProductName} Operator, then click *Istio Service Mesh ImportedServiceSet*.
. On the *Istio Service Mesh ImportedServiceSet* tab, click *Create ImportedServiceSet*.
. On the *Create ImportedServiceSet* page, click *YAML* to modify your configuration.
. Modify the default configuration with values for your import.
. Click *Create*. The Operator creates the import the based on your configuration parameters.
. To verify the `ImportedServiceSet` resource was created, click the *Istio Service Mesh ImportedServiceSet* tab.
.. Click the name of the new `ImportedServiceSet`; for example, `import-from-red-mesh`.
.. Click the *Resources* tab to see the `ImportedServiceSet` resource the Operator created and configured.

.Procedure

Follow this procedure to create an `ImportedServiceSet` from the command line.

. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Enter the following command. Then, enter your username and password when prompted.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<NAMEOFUSER> <API token> https://<HOSTNAME>:6443
----
+
. Change to the project where you installed the {SMProductShortName} control plane; for example, `green-mesh-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project green-mesh-system
----
+
. Create an `ImportedServiceSet` file based on the following example where `green-mesh` is importing services previously exported by `red-mesh`.
+
.Example ImportedServiceSet resource from red-mesh to green-mesh
[source,yaml]

      namespace: bookinfo
      name: red-ratings
      alias:
        namespace: bookinfo
        name: ratings
----
+
. Run the following command to upload and create the `ImportedServiceSet` resource in the green-mesh-system namespace.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n <ControlPlaneNamespace> -f <ImportedServiceSet.yaml>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n green-mesh-system -f import-from-red-mesh.yaml
----
+
. Create additional `ImportedServiceSet` resources as needed for each mesh peer in your federated mesh.

.Verification

//TODO - Add sample output after the validation

* Run the following command to verify that the services were imported into `green-mesh`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get importedserviceset <PeerMeshImportedInto> -o yaml
----
+
.Example verifying that the services exported from the red mesh have been imported into the green mesh using the status section of the `importedserviceset/red-mesh' object in the 'green-mesh-system` namespace
+

----
$ oc -n green-mesh-system get importedserviceset/red-mesh -o yaml
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
status:
  importedServices:
  - exportedName: red-ratings.bookinfo.svc.green-mesh-exports.local
    localService:

      name: ratings
      namespace: bookinfo
  - exportedName: reviews.red-mesh-bookinfo.svc.green-mesh-exports.local
    localService:
      hostname: ""
      name: ""
      namespace: ""
----
+
In the preceding example only the ratings service is imported, as indicated by the populated fields under `localService`. The reviews service is available for import, but is not currently imported because it does not match any `importRules` in the `ImportedServiceSet` object.

This module included in the following assemblies:
* service_mesh/v2x/ossm-federation.adoc
[id="ossm-federation-config-failover-overview_{context}"]
= Configuring a federated mesh for failover

Failover is the ability to switch automatically and seamlessly to a reliable backup system, for example another server. In the case of a federated mesh, you can configure a service in one mesh to failover to a service in another mesh.

You configure Federation for failover by setting the `importAsLocal` and `locality` settings in an `ImportedServiceSet` resource and then configuring a `DestinationRule` that configures failover for the service to the locality specified in the `ImportedServiceSet`.

.Prerequisites

* Two or more OpenShift Container Platform 4.6 or above clusters already networked and federated.
* `ExportedServiceSet` resources already created for each mesh peer in the federated mesh.
* `ImportedServiceSet` resources already created for each mesh peer in the federated mesh.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

= Configuring an ImportedServiceSet for failover

Locality-weighted load balancing allows administrators to control the distribution of traffic to endpoints based on the localities of where the traffic originates and where it will terminate. These localities are specified using arbitrary labels that designate a hierarchy of localities in {region}/{zone}/{sub-zone} form.

In the examples in this section, the `green-mesh` is located in the `us-east` region, and the `red-mesh` is located in the `us-west` region.

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit -n <smcp-system> -f <ImportedServiceSet.yaml>
----
+
For example, if you want to modify the file that imports from the red-mesh-system to the green-mesh-system as shown in the previous `ImportedServiceSet` example.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit -n green-mesh-system -f import-from-red-mesh.yaml

. Modify the file:
.. Set `spec.importRules.importAsLocal` to `true`.
.. Set `spec.locality` to a `region`, `zone`, or `subzone`.
.. Save your changes.

This module included in the following assemblies:
* service_mesh/v2x/ossm-federation.adoc
[id="ossm-federation-config-destinationrule-failover_{context}"]
= Configuring a DestinationRule for failover

Create a `DestinationRule` resource that configures the following:

* Outlier detection for the service. This is required in order for failover to function properly. In particular, it configures the sidecar proxies to know when endpoints for a service are unhealthy, eventually triggering a failover to the next locality.

* Failover policy between regions. This ensures that failover beyond a region boundary will behave predictably.

[id="ossm-federation-remove-service_{context}"]
= Removing a service from the federated mesh

If you need to remove a service from the federated mesh, for example if it has become obsolete or has been replaced by a different service, you can do so.

== To remove a service from a single mesh

Remove the entry for the service from the `ImportedServiceSet` resource for the mesh peer that no longer should access the service.

== To remove a service from the entire federated mesh

Remove the entry for the service from the `ExportedServiceSet` resource for the mesh that owns the service.

This module included in the following assemblies:
* service_mesh/v2x/ossm-federation.adoc

[id="ossm-federation-remove-mesh_{context}"]
= Removing a mesh from the federated mesh

If you need to remove a mesh from the federation, you can do so.

. Edit the removed mesh's `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to remove all federation ingress gateways for peer meshes.

. For each mesh peer that the removed mesh has been federated with:

.. Remove the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource that links the two meshes.

.. Edit the peer mesh's `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to remove the egress gateway that serves the removed mesh.
