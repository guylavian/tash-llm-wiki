# Allocating specific CPUs for nodes in a cluster

[id="nodes-nodes-resources-cpus"]
= Allocating specific CPUs for nodes in a cluster

[role="_abstract"]
When using the static CPU Manager policy, you can explicitly define a list of CPUs that are reserved for critical system processes on specific nodes. Reserving CPUs for critical system processes can help ensure cluster stability.

For example, on a system with 24 CPUs, you could reserve CPUs numbered 0 - 3 for the control plane allowing the compute nodes to use CPUs 4 - 23.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * nodes/nodes-nodes-resources-cpus

[role="_abstract"]
You can explicitly define a list of CPUs that are reserved for critical system processes on specific nodes by creating a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) to define the `reservedSystemCPUs` parameter. Reserving CPUs for critical system processes can help ensure cluster stability.

This list supersedes the CPUs that might be reserved by using the `systemReserved` parameter.

For more information on the `systemReserved` parameter, see "Allocating resources for nodes in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster".

.Prerequisites

. You have the label associated with the machine config pool (MCP) for the type of node you want to configure:

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for the `KubeletConfig` CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: set-reserved-cpus
spec:
  kubeletConfig:
    reservedSystemCPUs: "0,1,2,3"
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: ""
#...
----
where:

`metadata.name`:: Specifies a name for the CR.
`spec.kubeletConfig.reservedSystemCPUs`:: Specifies the core IDs of the CPUs you want to reserve for the nodes associated with the MCP.
`spec.machineConfigPoolSelector.matchLabels`:: Specifies the label from the MCP.

. Create the CR object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
