# Understanding network policy APIs

[id="network-policy-apis"]
= Understanding network policy APIs

[role="_abstract"]
Network policy is defined using both cluster-scoped and namespace-scoped network policy APIs. By defining network policy across these different levels, you can create sophisticated network security configurations for your clusters, including full multi-tenant isolation.

[id="nw-anp-np-scope"]
== Network policies and their scope

Cluster-scoped network policy:: Cluster and network administrators can use the AdminNetworkPolicy to define network policy at the cluster level. The AdminNetworkPolicy feature consists of two APIs: the `AdminNetworkPolicy` API and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` API. These APIs are used to set rules that can be applied to the entire cluster, or delegated to the namespace-scoped `NetworkPolicy`.
+
Policies defined using the `AdminNetworkPolicy` API take precedence over all other policy types when set to "Allow" or "Deny". However, administrators can also use "Pass" to delegate responsibility for a given policy to the namespace-scoped `NetworkPolicy` to allow application developers and namespace tenants to control specific aspects of network security for their projects.
+
Policies defined using the `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` API apply only when no other network policy overrides them. When you use the `AdminNetworkPolicy` API to delegate an aspect of network policy to the namespace-scoped `NetworkPolicy`, you should also define a sensible minimum restriction in the `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy`. This ensures a baseline level of network security at the cluster level in case the `NetworkPolicy` for a namespace does not provide sufficient protection.

Namespace-scoped network policy:: Application developers and namespace tenants can use the `NetworkPolicy` API to define network policy rules for a specific namespace. Rules in the `NetworkPolicy` for a namespace take precedence over cluster-wide rules configured using the BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy API, or for a cluster-wide rule that has been delegated or "passed" from the cluster-wide `AdminNetworkPolicy` API.

[id="nw-anp-np-evaluation"]
== How network policy is evaluated and applied

When a network connection is established, the network provider (default: OVN-Kubernetes) checks the connection details against network policy rules to determine how to handle the connection.

OVN-Kubernetes evaluates connections against network policy objects in the following order:

. Check for matches in the AdminNetworkPolicy tier.
.. If a connection matches an `Allow` or `Deny` rule, follow that rule and stop evaluating.
.. If a connection matches a `Pass` rule, move to the NetworkPolicy tier.
. Check for matches in the NetworkPolicy tier.
.. If a connection matches a rule, follow that rule and stop evaluating.
.. If no match is found, move to the BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy tier.
. Follow a matching rule in the BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy tier.

// TODO OSDOCS-11830: If a change to network policies or other objects impacts an existing network connection...

// TODO OSDOCS-11830: Retaining old text until approved:
// OVN-Kubernetes CNI in OpenShift Container Platform implements these network policies using Access Control List (ACL) Tiers to evaluate and apply them. ACLs are evaluated in descending order from Tier 1 to Tier 3.
// Tier 1 evaluates `AdminNetworkPolicy` (ANP) objects. Tier 2 evaluates `NetworkPolicy` objects. Tier 3 evaluates `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` (BANP) objects.
// ANPs are evaluated first. When the match is an ANP `allow` or `deny` rule, any existing `NetworkPolicy` and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` (BANP) objects in the cluster are skipped from evaluation. When the match is an ANP `pass` rule, then evaluation moves from tier 1 of the ACL to tier 2 where the `NetworkPolicy` policy is evaluated. If no `NetworkPolicy` matches the traffic then evaluation moves from tier 2 ACLs to tier 3 ACLs where BANP is evaluated.

= Key differences between AdminNetworkPolicy and NetworkPolicy custom resources

[role="_abstract"]
To choose the right network policy API for your cluster or namespace in OpenShift Container Platform, you can compare `AdminNetworkPolicy` and `NetworkPolicy` CRs across scope, rule actions, precedence, and peer options.

The following reference table highlights differences in who can apply policies, how traffic is allowed or denied, and how OVN-Kubernetes evaluates each API.

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Policy elements | AdminNetworkPolicy | NetworkPolicy

|Applicable user
|Cluster administrator or equivalent
|Namespace owners

|Scope
|Cluster
|Namespace

|Drop traffic
|Supported with an explicit `Deny` action set as a rule.
|Supported via implicit `Deny` isolation at policy creation time.

|Delegate traffic
|Supported with an `Pass` action set as a rule.
|Not applicable.

|Allow traffic
|Supported with an explicit `Allow` action set as a rule.
|The default action for all rules is to allow.

|Rule precedence within the policy
|Depends on the order in which they appear within an ANP. The higher the rule's position the higher the precedence.
|Rules are additive.

|Policy precedence
|Among ANPs the `priority` field sets the order for evaluation. The lower the priority number higher the policy precedence.
|There is no policy ordering between policies.

|Feature precedence
|Evaluated first via tier 1 ACL and BANP is evaluated last via tier 3 ACL.
|Enforced after ANP and before BANP, they are evaluated in tier 2 of the ACL.

|Matching pod selection
|Can apply different rules across namespaces.
|Can apply different rules across pods in single namespace.

|Cluster egress traffic
|Supported via `nodes` and `networks` peers
|Supported through `ipBlock` field along with accepted CIDR syntax.

|Cluster ingress traffic
|Not supported.
|Not supported.

|Fully qualified domain names (FQDN) peer support
|Not supported.
|Not supported.

|Namespace selectors
|Supports advanced selection of Namespaces with the use of `namespaces.matchLabels` field.
|Supports label based namespace selection with the use of `namespaceSelector` field.
