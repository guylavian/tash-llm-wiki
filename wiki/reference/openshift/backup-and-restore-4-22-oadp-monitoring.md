# OADP monitoring

[id="oadp-monitoring"]
= OADP monitoring

[role="_abstract"]
Monitor {oadp-short} operations by using the OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack to create service monitors, configure alerting rules, and view metrics. This helps you track backup and restore performance, manage clusters, and receive alerts for important events.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/oadp-monitoring.adoc

[id="oadp-monitoring-setup-monitor_{context}"]
= OADP monitoring setup

[role="_abstract"]
Set up {oadp-short} monitoring by enabling User Workload Monitoring and configuring the OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack to retrieve Velero metrics. This helps you create alerting rules, query metrics, and optionally visualize data by using Prometheus-compatible tools such as Grafana.

Monitoring metrics requires enabling monitoring for the user-defined projects and creating a `ServiceMonitor` resource to scrape those metrics from the already enabled {oadp-short} service endpoint in the `openshift-adp` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
The {oadp-short} support for Prometheus metrics is offered on a best-effort basis and is not fully supported.
====

For more information about setting up the monitoring stack, see Configuring user workload monitoring.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have created a cluster monitoring config map.

.Procedure

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config -n openshift-monitoring
----

. Add or enable the `enableUserWorkload` option in the `data` section's `config.yaml` field by using the following command:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true
metadata:
# ...
----
+
where:

`enableUserWorkload`:: Add this option or set to `true`.

. Wait a short period to verify the User Workload Monitoring Setup by checking that the following components are up and running in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring
----
+

[source,terminal]
----

thanos-ruler-user-workload-1           3/3     Running   0          32s
----
+
. Verify the existence of the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring`. If it exists, skip the remaining steps in this procedure.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap user-workload-monitoring-config -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring
----
+

[source,terminal]
----
Error from server (NotFound): configmaps "user-workload-monitoring-config" not found
----
+
. Create a `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object for the User Workload Monitoring, and save it under the `2_configure_user_workload_monitoring.yaml` file name:
+
[source,yaml]
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
----
+
. Apply the `2_configure_user_workload_monitoring.yaml` file by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f 2_configure_user_workload_monitoring.yaml

[id="oadp-creating-service-monitor_{context}"]
= Creating OADP service monitor

[role="_abstract"]
Create a `ServiceMonitor` resource to scrape Velero metrics from the {oadp-short} service endpoint. This helps you collect metrics for monitoring backup and restore operations in the OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack.

{oadp-short} provides an `openshift-adp-velero-metrics-svc` service. The user workload monitoring service monitor must use the `openshift-adp-velero-metrics-svc` service.

.Procedure

. Ensure that the `openshift-adp-velero-metrics-svc` service exists. It should contain `app.kubernetes.io/name=velero` label, which is used as selector for the `ServiceMonitor` object.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get svc -n openshift-adp -l app.kubernetes.io/name=velero
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
openshift-adp-velero-metrics-svc   ClusterIP   172.30.38.244   <none>        8085/TCP   1h
----

. Create a `ServiceMonitor` YAML file that matches the existing service label, and save the file as `3_create_oadp_service_monitor.yaml`. The service monitor is created in the `openshift-adp` namespace which has the `openshift-adp-velero-metrics-svc` service.
+
[source,yaml]
+
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    app: oadp-service-monitor
  name: oadp-service-monitor
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  endpoints:
  - interval: 30s
    path: /metrics
    targetPort: 8085
    scheme: http
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: "velero"
----

. Apply the `3_create_oadp_service_monitor.yaml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f 3_create_oadp_service_monitor.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
servicemonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/oadp-service-monitor created
----

.Verification

* Confirm that the new service monitor is in an *Up* state by using the *Administrator* perspective of the OpenShift Container Platform web console. Wait a few minutes for the service monitor to reach the *Up* state.
.. Navigate to the *Observe* -> *Targets* page.
.. Ensure the *Filter* is unselected or that the *User* source is selected and type `openshift-adp` in the `Text` search field.
.. Verify that the status for the *Status* for the service monitor is *Up*.

[id="creating-alerting-rules_{context}"]
= Creating an alerting rule

[role="_abstract"]
Create a `PrometheusRule` resource to configure alerting rules for {oadp-short} backup operations. This helps you receive notifications when backup failures or other issues occur in your environment.

The OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack receives alerts configured by using alerting rules. To create an alerting rule for the {oadp-short} project, use one of the metrics scraped with the user workload monitoring.

.Procedure

. Create a `PrometheusRule` YAML file with the sample `OADPBackupFailing` alert and save it as `4_create_oadp_alert_rule.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
+
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: sample-oadp-alert
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  groups:
  - name: sample-oadp-backup-alert
    rules:
    - alert: OADPBackupFailing
      annotations:
        description: 'OADP had {{$value | humanize}} backup failures over the last 2 hours.'
        summary: OADP has issues creating backups
      expr: |
        increase(velero_backup_failure_total{job="openshift-adp-velero-metrics-svc"}[2h]) > 0
      for: 5m
      labels:
        severity: warning
----
+
In this sample, the Alert displays under the following conditions:
+
* During the last 2 hours, the number of new failing backups was greater than 0 and the state persisted for at least 5 minutes.
* If the time of the first increase is less than 5 minutes, the Alert is in a `Pending` state, after which it turns into a `Firing` state.

. Apply the `4_create_oadp_alert_rule.yaml` file, which creates the `PrometheusRule` object in the `openshift-adp` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f 4_create_oadp_alert_rule.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
prometheusrule.monitoring.coreos.com/sample-oadp-alert created
----

.Verification

* After the Alert is triggered, you can view it in the following ways:
** In the *Developer* perspective, select the *Observe* menu.
** In the *Administrator* perspective under the *Observe* -> *Alerting* menu, select *User* in the *Filter* box. Otherwise, by default only the *Platform* Alerts are displayed.
