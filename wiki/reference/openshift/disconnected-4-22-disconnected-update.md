# Updating a cluster in a disconnected environment without the OpenShift Update Service

[id="updating-disconnected-cluster"]
= Updating a cluster in a disconnected environment without the OpenShift Update Service
[id="updating-disconnected-cluster"]
= Updating a cluster in a disconnected environment by using the CLI

Use the following procedures to update a cluster in a disconnected environment without access to the OpenShift Update Service.

== Prerequisites

* You must have the `oc` command-line interface (CLI) tool installed.
* You must provision a local container image registry with the container images for your update, as described in Mirroring OpenShift Container Platform images.
* You must have access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See Using RBAC to define and apply permissions.
* You must have a recent etcd backup in case your update fails and you must restore your cluster to a previous state.
* You have updated all Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to a version that is compatible with your target release. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid update path when the default catalog sources switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update. See Updating installed Operators for more information on how to check compatibility and, if necessary, update the installed Operators.
* You must ensure that all machine config pools (MCPs) are running and not paused. Nodes associated with a paused MCP are skipped during the update process. You can pause the MCPs if you are performing a canary rollout update strategy.
* If your cluster uses manually maintained credentials, update the cloud provider resources for the new release. For more information, including how to determine if this is a requirement for your cluster, see Preparing to update a cluster with manually maintained credentials.
* If you run an Operator or you have configured any application with the pod disruption budget, you might experience an interruption during the update process. If `minAvailable` is set to 1 in `PodDisruptionBudget`, the nodes are drained to apply pending machine configs which might block the eviction process. If several nodes are rebooted, all the pods might run on only one node, and the `PodDisruptionBudget` field can prevent the node drain.

[id="machine-health-checks-pausing_{context}"]
= Pausing a MachineHealthCheck resource

[role="_abstract"]
During the update process, nodes in the cluster might become temporarily unavailable. For worker nodes, the `MachineHealthCheck` resources might identify such nodes as unhealthy and reboot them. To avoid rebooting worker nodes, you must pause all the `MachineHealthCheck` resources before updating the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Some `MachineHealthCheck` resources might not need to be paused. If your `MachineHealthCheck` resource relies on unrecoverable conditions, pausing that MHC is unnecessary.
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. List all of the available `MachineHealthCheck` resources that you want to pause by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinehealthcheck -n openshift-machine-api
----

. For each `MachineHealthCheck` resource, pause the machine health check by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-machine-api annotate mhc <mhc_name> cluster.x-k8s.io/paused=""
----
+
The annotated `MachineHealthCheck` resource resembles the following YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineHealthCheck
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
  annotations:
    cluster.x-k8s.io/paused: ""
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      role: worker
  unhealthyConditions:
  - type:    "Ready"
    status:  "Unknown"
    timeout: "300s"
  - type:    "Ready"
    status:  "False"
    timeout: "300s"
  maxUnhealthy: "40%"
status:
  currentHealthy: 5
  expectedMachines: 5
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Resume the machine health checks after updating the cluster. To resume the check, remove the pause annotation from the `MachineHealthCheck` resource by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-machine-api annotate mhc <mhc-name> cluster.x-k8s.io/paused-

[id="update-disconnected-image-digests_{context}"]
= Retrieving a release image digest

In order to update a cluster in a disconnected environment using the `oc adm upgrade` command with the `--to-image` option, you must reference the sha256 digest that corresponds to your targeted release image.

.Procedure

. Run the following command on a device that is connected to the internet:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release info -o 'jsonpath={.digest}{"\n"}' quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:${OCP_RELEASE_VERSION}-${ARCHITECTURE}
----
+
For `{OCP_RELEASE_VERSION}`, specify the version of OpenShift Container Platform to which you want to update, such as `4.10.16`.
+
For `{ARCHITECTURE}`, specify the architecture of the cluster, such as `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `s390x`, or `ppc64le`.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
sha256:a8bfba3b6dddd1a2fbbead7dac65fe4fb8335089e4e7cae327f3bad334add31d
----

. Copy the sha256 digest for use when updating your cluster.

// Updating the disconnected cluster
// Module included in the following assemblies:
//

[id="update-disconnected_{context}"]
= Updating the disconnected cluster

Update the disconnected cluster to the OpenShift Container Platform version that you downloaded the release images for.

//TODO: Add xrefs in the following note when functionality is enabled.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a local OpenShift Update Service, you can update by using the connected web console or CLI instructions instead of this procedure.
====

.Prerequisites

* You mirrored the images for the new release to your registry.
* You applied the release image signature ConfigMap for the new release to your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The release image signature config map allows the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) to ensure the integrity of release images by verifying that the actual image signatures match the expected signatures.
====
* You obtained the sha256 digest for your targeted release image.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You paused all `MachineHealthCheck` resources.

.Procedure

* Update the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --allow-explicit-upgrade --to-image <defined_registry>/<defined_repository>@<digest>
----
+
--
Where:

`<defined_registry>`:: Specifies the name of the mirror registry you mirrored your images to.

`<defined_repository>`:: Specifies the name of the image repository you want to use on the mirror registry.

`<digest>`:: Specifies the sha256 digest for the targeted release image, for example, `sha256:81154f5c03294534e1eaf0319bef7a601134f891689ccede5d705ef659aa8c92`.
--
+
[NOTE]
====
* See "Mirroring OpenShift Container Platform images" to review how your mirror registry and repository names are defined.

* If you used an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` or `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, you can use the canonical registry and repository names instead of the names you defined.
The canonical registry name is `quay.io` and the canonical repository name is `openshift-release-dev/ocp-release`.

* You can only configure global pull secrets for clusters that have an `ImageContentSourcePolicy`, `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, or `ImageTagMirrorSet` object. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.

[id="images-configuration-registry-mirror_{context}"]
= Understanding image registry repository mirroring

[role="_abstract"]
By setting up container registry repository mirroring, you can perform the following tasks:

* Configure your OpenShift Container Platform cluster to redirect requests to pull images from a repository on a source image registry and have it resolved by a repository on a mirrored image registry.
* Identify multiple mirrored repositories for each target repository, to make sure that if one mirror is down, another can be used.

Repository mirroring in OpenShift Container Platform includes the following attributes:

* Image pulls are resilient to registry downtimes.
* Clusters in disconnected environments can pull images from critical locations, such as `quay.io`, and have registries behind a company firewall provide the requested images.
* A particular order of registries is tried when an image pull request is made, with the permanent registry typically being the last one tried.
* The mirror information you enter is added to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file on every node in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* The mirror information you enter is added to the appropriate `hosts.toml` containerd configuration file(s) on every Windows node in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* When a node makes a request for an image from the source repository, it tries each mirrored repository in turn until it finds the requested content. If all mirrors fail, the cluster tries the source repository. If successful, the image is pulled to the node.

You can set up repository mirroring in the following ways:

* At OpenShift Container Platform installation:
+
By pulling container images needed by OpenShift Container Platform and then bringing those images behind your company's firewall, you can install OpenShift Container Platform into a data center that is in a disconnected environment.

* After OpenShift Container Platform installation:
+
If you did not configure mirroring during OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can do so postinstallation by using any of the following custom resource (CR) objects:
+
** `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS). This object allows you to pull images from a mirrored registry by using digest specifications. The IDMS CR enables you to set a fall back policy that allows or stops continued attempts to pull from the source registry if the image pull fails.
+
** `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS). This object allows you to pull images from a mirrored registry by using image tags. The ITMS CR enables you to set a fall back policy that allows or stops continued attempts to pull from the source registry if the image pull fails.
// ICSP is not supported in WINC
+
** `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP). This object allows you to pull images from a mirrored registry by using digest specifications. The ICSP CR always falls back to the source registry if the mirrors do not work.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Using an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) object to configure repository mirroring is a deprecated feature. Deprecated functionality is still included in OpenShift Container Platform and continues to be supported. It will be removed in a future release and is not recommended for new deployments.

If you have existing YAML files that you used to create `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects, you can use the `oc adm migrate icsp` command to convert those files to a `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML files. For more information, see "Converting ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files for image registry repository mirroring".
====

Each of these custom resource objects identify the following information:

* The source of the container image repository you want to mirror.
* A separate entry for each mirror repository you want to offer the content

Note the following actions and how they affect node drain behavior:

* If you create an IDMS or ICSP CR object, the MCO does not drain or reboot the node.
* If you create an ITMS CR object, the MCO drains and reboots the node.
* If you delete an ITMS, IDMS, or ICSP CR object, the MCO drains and reboots the node.
* If you modify an ITMS, IDMS, or ICSP CR object, the MCO drains and reboots the node.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====

====
* If you delete an ITMS or IDMS CR object, the MCO drains and reboots the node.
* If you modify an ITMS or IDMS CR object, the MCO drains and reboots the node.

For new clusters, you can use IDMS, ITMS, and ICSP CRs objects as needed. However, using IDMS and ITMS is recommended.

If you upgraded a cluster, any existing ICSP objects remain stable, and both IDMS and ICSP objects are supported. Workloads that use ICSP objects continue to function as expected. However, if you want to take advantage of the fallback policies introduced in the IDMS CRs, you can migrate current workloads to IDMS objects by using the `oc adm migrate icsp` command as shown in the *Converting ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files for image registry repository mirroring* section that follows. Migrating to IDMS objects does not require a cluster reboot.

The Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) watches for changes to the IDMS and ITMS resources and generates a set of `hosts.toml` containerd configuration files, one file for each source registry, with those changes. The WMCO then updates any existing Windows nodes to use the new registry configuration.

[NOTE]
====
The IDMS and ITMS objects must be created before you can add Windows nodes using a mirrored registry.

[id="images-configuration-registry-mirror-configuring_{context}"]
= Configuring image registry repository mirroring

[role="_abstract"]
You can create postinstallation mirror configuration custom resources (CR) to redirect image pull requests from a source image registry to a mirrored image registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Windows images mirrored through `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and `ImageTagMirrorSet` objects have specific naming requirements as described in "Using Windows containers with a mirror registry".
====

.Prerequisites
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Configure mirrored repositories, by either:
+
--
* Setting up a mirrored repository with {quay}. You can copy images from one repository to another and also automatically sync those repositories repeatedly over time by using {quay}.

** {quay} Repository Mirroring

* Using a tool such as `skopeo` to copy images manually from the source repository to the mirrored repository.
+
For example, after installing the skopeo RPM package on a {op-system-base-full system}, use the `skopeo` command as shown in the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ skopeo copy --all \
docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal:latest@sha256:5cf... \
docker://example.io/example/ubi-minimal
----
+
In this example, you have a container image registry named `example.io` and image repository named `example`. You want to copy the `ubi9/ubi-minimal` image from `registry.access.redhat.com` to `example.io`. After you create the mirrored registry, you can configure your OpenShift Container Platform cluster to redirect requests made to the source repository to the mirrored repository.
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must mirror the `mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:3.9` image. For example, you could use the following `skopeo` command to mirror the image:

[source,terminal]
----
$ skopeo copy \
docker://mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:3.9\
docker://example.io/oss/kubernetes/pause:3.9
----
====

. Log in to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

. Create a postinstallation mirror configuration custom resource (CR), by using one of the following examples:
//should note oc mirror v2 for users here; this set of docs contains mixed examples
* Create an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` or `ImageTagMirrorSet` CR, as needed, replacing the source and mirrors with your own registry and repository pairs and images:

.Troubleshooting

If the repository mirroring procedure does not work as described, use the following information about how repository mirroring works to help troubleshoot the problem:

* The first working mirror is used to supply the pulled image.
* The main registry is only used if no other mirror works.
* From the system context, the `Insecure` flags are used as fallback.
* The format of the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file has changed recently. It is now version 2 and in TOML format.

= Converting ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files for image registry repository mirroring

[role="_abstract"]
Using an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) object to configure repository mirroring is a deprecated feature.

This functionality is still included in OpenShift Container Platform and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

ICSP objects are being replaced by `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and `ImageTagMirrorSet` objects to configure repository mirroring. If you have existing YAML files that you used to create `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects, you can use the `oc adm migrate icsp` command to convert those files to an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML file. The command updates the API to the current version, changes the `kind` value to `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, and changes `spec.repositoryDigestMirrors` to `spec.imageDigestMirrors`. The rest of the file is not changed.

Because the migration does not change the `registries.conf` file, the cluster does not need to reboot.

For more information about `ImageDigestMirrorSet` or `ImageTagMirrorSet` objects, see "Configuring image registry repository mirroring" in the previous section.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.

* Ensure that you have `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects on your cluster.

.Procedure

. Use the following command to convert one or more `ImageContentSourcePolicy` YAML files to an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm migrate icsp <file_name>.yaml <file_name>.yaml <file_name>.yaml --dest-dir <path_to_the_directory>
----
+
where:
+
`<file_name>`:: Specifies the name of the source `ImageContentSourcePolicy` YAML. You can list multiple file names.
`--dest-dir`:: Optional: Specifies a directory for the output `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML. If unset, the file is written to the current directory.
+
For example, the following command converts the `icsp.yaml` and `icsp-2.yaml` file and saves the new YAML files to the `idms-files` directory.

= Widening the scope of the mirror image catalog to reduce the frequency of cluster node reboots

You can scope the mirrored image catalog at the repository level or the wider registry level. A widely scoped `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource reduces the number of times the nodes need to reboot in response to changes to the resource.

To widen the scope of the mirror image catalog in the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource, perform the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Container Platform CLI `oc`.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Configure a mirrored image catalog for use in your disconnected cluster.

.Procedure

. Run the following command, specifying values for `<local_registry>`, `<pull_spec>`, and `<pull_secret_file>`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror <local_registry>/<pull_spec> <local_registry> -a <pull_secret_file> --icsp-scope=registry
----
+
where:
+
--
<local_registry>:: is the local registry you have configured for your disconnected cluster, for example, `local.registry:5000`.
<pull_spec>:: is the pull specification as configured in your disconnected registry, for example, `redhat/redhat-operator-index:v`
<pull_secret_file>:: is the `registry.redhat.io` pull secret in `.json` file format. You can download the {cluster-manager-url-pull}.
--
+
The `oc adm catalog mirror` command creates a `/redhat-operator-index-manifests` directory and generates `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml`, `catalogSource.yaml`, and `mapping.txt` files.

. Apply the new `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----

.Verification

* Verify that `oc apply` successfully applied the change to `ImageContentSourcePolicy`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ImageContentSourcePolicy -o yaml
----
+
.Example output

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
  metadata:
    annotations:
      kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |

...
----

After you update the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource, OpenShift Container Platform deploys the new settings to each node and the cluster starts using the mirrored repository for requests to the source repository.
