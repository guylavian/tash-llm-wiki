# Restoring applications

[id="restoring-applications"]
= Restoring applications

[role="_abstract"]
Restore application backups by previewing resources before running the restore, creating a `Restore` custom resource (CR), and configuring restore hooks to run commands in restored pods. This helps you to recover your application data and configuration while controlling the restore process.

// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/restoring-applications.adoc
// * backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc

[id="oadp-review-backup-restore_{context}"]
= Previewing resources before running backup and restore

[role="_abstract"]
Preview the backup and restore resources in advance by doing a dry run of the backup and restore operations. This helps you to verify which resources will be included before committing to a full backup or restore.

{oadp-short} backs up application resources based on the type, namespace, or label. This means that you can view the resources after the backup is complete. Similarly, you can view the restored objects based on the namespace, persistent volume (PV), or label after a restore operation is complete.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OADP Operator.

.Procedure

. To preview the resources included in the backup before running the actual backup, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ velero backup create <backup-name> --snapshot-volumes false
----
+
Specify the value of `--snapshot-volumes` parameter as `false`.

. To know more details about the backup resources, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ velero describe backup <backup_name> --details
----
+
Replace `<backup_name>` with the name of the backup.

. To preview the resources included in the restore before running the actual restore, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ velero restore create --from-backup <backup_name>
----
+
Replace `<backup_name>` with the name of the backup.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `velero restore create` command creates restore resources in the cluster. You must delete the resources created as part of the restore, after you review the resources.
====
+
. To know more details about the restore resources, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ velero describe restore <restore_name> --details
----
+
Replace `<restore_name>` with the name of the restore.

[id="oadp-creating-restore-cr_{context}"]
= Creating a Restore CR

[role="_abstract"]
Restore a `Backup` custom resource (CR) by creating a `Restore` CR.

When you restore a stateful application that uses the `azurefile-csi` storage class, the restore operation remains in the `Finalizing` phase.

.Prerequisites

* You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.
* The `DataProtectionApplication` CR must be in a `Ready` state.
* You must have a Velero `Backup` CR.
* The persistent volume (PV) capacity must match the requested size at backup time. Adjust the requested size if needed.

.Procedure

. Create a `Restore` CR, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: <restore>
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: <backup>
  includedResources: []
  excludedResources:
  - nodes
  - events
  - events.events.k8s.io
  - backups.velero.io
  - restores.velero.io
  - resticrepositories.velero.io
  restorePVs: true
----
+
where:

`<backup>`:: Specifies the name of the `Backup` CR.
`includedResources`:: Optional: Specifies an array of resources to include in the restore process. Resources might be shortcuts (for example, `po` for `pods`) or fully-qualified. If unspecified, all resources are included.
`restorePVs: true`:: Optional: The `restorePVs` parameter can be set to `false` to turn off restore of `PersistentVolumes` from `VolumeSnapshot` of Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots or from native snapshots when `VolumeSnapshotLocation` is configured.

. Verify that the status of the `Restore` CR is `Completed` by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get restores.velero.io -n openshift-adp <restore> -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'
----

. Verify that the backup resources have been restored by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -n <namespace>
----
+
where:

`<namespace>`:: Specifies the namespace that you backed up.

. If you restore `DeploymentConfig` with volumes or if you use post-restore hooks, run the `dc-post-restore.sh` cleanup script by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ bash dc-restic-post-restore.sh -> dc-post-restore.sh
----
+
[NOTE]
====
During the restore process, the OADP Velero plug-ins scale down the `DeploymentConfig` objects and restore the pods as standalone pods. This is done to prevent the cluster from deleting the restored `DeploymentConfig` pods immediately on restore and to allow the restore and post-restore hooks to complete their actions on the restored pods. The cleanup script shown below removes these disconnected pods and scales any `DeploymentConfig` objects back up to the appropriate number of replicas.

[id="oadp-creating-restore-hooks_{context}"]
= Creating restore hooks

[role="_abstract"]
Create restore hooks to run commands in a container in a pod by editing the `Restore` custom resource (CR).

You can create two types of restore hooks:

* An `init` hook adds an init container to a pod to perform setup tasks before the application container starts.
+
If you restore a Restic backup, the `restic-wait` init container is added before the restore hook init container.

* An `exec` hook runs commands or scripts in a container of a restored pod.

.Procedure

* Add a hook to the `spec.hooks` block of the `Restore` CR, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: <restore>
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  hooks:
    resources:
      - name: <hook_name>
        includedNamespaces:
        - <namespace>
        excludedNamespaces:
        - <namespace>
        includedResources:
        - pods
        excludedResources: []

          matchLabels:
            app: velero

        - init:
            initContainers:
            - name: restore-hook-init
              image: alpine:latest
              volumeMounts:
              - mountPath: /restores/pvc1-vm
                name: pvc1-vm
              command:
              - /bin/ash
              - -c
            timeout:
        - exec:
            container: <container>
            command:
            - /bin/bash
            - -c
            - "psql < /backup/backup.sql"
            waitTimeout: 5m
            execTimeout: 1m
            onError: Continue
----
+
where:

`<namespace>`:: Optional: Specifies an array of namespaces to which the hook applies. If this value is not specified, the hook applies to all namespaces.
`pods`:: Currently, pods are the only supported resource that hooks can apply to.
`labelSelector`:: Optional: This hook only applies to objects matching the label selector.
`timeout`:: Optional: Specifies the maximum length of time Velero waits for `initContainers` to complete.
`<container>`:: Optional: Specifies the container in which the command runs. If the container is not specified, the command runs in the first container in the pod.
`/bin/bash`:: Specifies the entrypoint for the init container being added.
`waitTimeout: 5m`:: Optional: Specifies how long to wait for a container to become ready. This should be long enough for the container to start and for any preceding hooks in the same container to complete. If not set, the restore process waits indefinitely.
`execTimeout: 1m`:: Optional: Specifies how long to wait for the commands to run. The default is `30s`.
`onError: Continue`:: Specifies the error handling behavior. Allowed values are `Fail` and `Continue`:
** `Continue`: Only command failures are logged.
** `Fail`: No more restore hooks run in any container in any pod. The status of the `Restore` CR will be `PartiallyFailed`.
