# Required AWS service quotas

[id="rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas"]
= Required AWS service quotas

[role="_abstract"]
Review this list of the required Amazon Web Service (AWS) service quotas that are required to run an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

// Module included in the following assemblies:

// * rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-required-aws-service-quotas.adoc
// * rosa_planning/rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas.adoc

[id="rosa-required-aws-service-quotas_{context}"]
= Required AWS service quotas

[role="_abstract"]
The table below describes the AWS service quotas and levels required to create and run one OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Although most default values are suitable for most workloads, you might need to request additional quota for the following cases:

* OpenShift Container Platform clusters require a minimum AWS EC2 service quota of
100{nbsp}vCPUs
32{nbsp}vCPUs
to provide for cluster creation, availability, and upgrades. The default maximum value for vCPUs assigned to Running On-Demand Standard Amazon EC2 instances is `5`. Therefore if you have not created a OpenShift Container Platform cluster using the same AWS account previously, you must request additional EC2 quota for `Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) instances`.

//TODO OSDOCS-11789 confirm number of secgroups on HCP clusters - Bala says 10, who can confirm?
* Some optional cluster configuration features, such as custom security groups, might require you to request additional quota. For example, because OpenShift Container Platform associates 1 security group with network interfaces in worker machine pools by default, and the default quota for `Security groups per network interface` is `5`, if you want to add 5 custom security groups, you must request additional quota, because this would bring the total number of security groups on worker network interfaces to 6.

[NOTE]
====
The AWS SDK allows OpenShift Container Platform to check quotas, but the AWS SDK calculation does not account for your existing usage. Therefore, it is possible for cluster creation to fail because of a lack of available quota even though the AWS SDK quota check passes. To fix this issue, increase your quota.
====

If you need to modify or increase a specific AWS quota, see Amazon's documentation on requesting a quota increase. Large quota requests are submitted to Amazon Support for review, and can take some time to be approved. If your quota request is urgent, contact AWS Support.
