# Installing a cluster on IBM PowerVC with customizations

[id="installing-ibm-powervc-installer-custom"]
= Installing a cluster on IBM PowerVC with customizations

[role="_abstract"]
In OpenShift Container Platform version , you can install a customized cluster on {ibm-power-vc-name}. To customize the installation, modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` before you install the cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You have a load balancing service you can use with the {ibm-power-vc-name} network you intend to use.
* You have a DHCP server backing the {ibm-power-vc-name} network you intend to use.

= Infrastructure requirements for installing OpenShift Container Platform on {ibm-power-vc-name}

[role="_abstract"]
To support an OpenShift Container Platform installation by using the installation program, you need to prepare your {ibm-power-vc-name} environment.

[id="installation-ibm-powervc-infra-requirements-account_{context}"]
== {ibm-power-vc-name} account privilege requirements

When installing OpenShift Container Platform on {ibm-power-vc-name} by using the installation program, you must use an administrative account to ensure that you have all required permissions.

[id="installation-ibm-powervc-infra-requirements-image_{context}"]
== {ibm-power-vc-name} image requirements
You must import a {op-system-first} image. This can be found by using the installation program.

[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install coreos print-stream-json | jq -r '.architectures.ppc64le.artifacts.openstack' | jq -r '.formats."qcow2.gz".disk.location'
----

After downloading the image from the resultant URL, you can import the image into {ibm-power-vc-name} by using the `powervc-image-import` tool.

[id="installation-ibm-powervc-infra-requirements-networking_{context}"]
== Networking requirements

== {ibm-power-vc-name} network
Installation requires at least one PowerVC network. Ideally the network should be dedicated to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster and not shared with other workloads.

IBM recommends that the network is set as a DHCP network in {ibm-power-vc-name}. You must have a DHCP server set up to assign addresses for this network. When using this type of network, {ibm-power-vc-name} is not aware of the IP address that is assigned to the created servers.

== DNS records
DNS records pointing to a `LoadBalancer` service are required for installation. In each record, `<cluster_name>` is the cluster name and `<base_domain>` is the cluster base domain that you specify when you install the cluster. A complete DNS record takes the form: `<component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`.

.Required DNS records
[cols="1a,5a,3a",options="header"]
|===

|Component
|Record
|Description

|API VIP
|`api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|This DNS A/AAAA or CNAME (Canonical Name) record must point to the load balancer for the cluster. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

|API VIP
|`api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|This DNS A/AAAA or CNAME (Canonical Name) record must point to the load balancer for the cluster. This record must be resolvable by all the nodes within the cluster.

|Ingress VIP
|`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.`
|A wildcard DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record that points to the load balancer that targets the machines that run the Ingress router pods, which are the compute nodes by default. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and from all the nodes within the cluster.

[id="installation-load-balancing-user-infra_{context}"]
= Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

[role="_abstract"]
Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, you must provision the API and application Ingress load balancing infrastructure. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, you can provision your own API and application ingress load balancing infrastructure to use in place of the default, internal load balancing solution. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers with a {op-system-base-full} instance, you must purchase the {op-system-base} subscription separately.
====

The load balancing infrastructure must meet the following requirements:

* API load balancer: Provides a common endpoint for users, both human and machine, to interact with and configure the platform. Configure the following conditions:

** Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
** A stateless load balancing algorithm. The options vary based on the load balancer implementation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not configure session persistence for an API load balancer. Configuring session persistence for a Kubernetes API server might cause performance issues from excess application traffic for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster and the Kubernetes API that runs inside the cluster.
====

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the API load balancers:

[cols="2,5,^2,^2,2",options="header"]
|===

|Port
|Back-end machines (pool members)
|Internal
|External
|Description

|`6443`
|Bootstrap and control plane. You remove the bootstrap machine from the load
balancer after the bootstrap machine initializes the cluster control plane. You
must configure the `/readyz` endpoint for the API server health check probe.
|X
|X
|Kubernetes API server

|`22623`
|Bootstrap and control plane. You remove the bootstrap machine from the load
balancer after the bootstrap machine initializes the cluster control plane.
|X
|
|Machine config server

|===

[NOTE]
====
The load balancer must be configured to take a maximum of 30 seconds from the
time the API server turns off the `/readyz` endpoint to the removal of the API
server instance from the pool. Within the time frame after `/readyz` returns an
error or becomes healthy, the endpoint must have been removed or added. Probing
every 5 or 10 seconds, with two successful requests to become healthy and three
to become unhealthy, are well-tested values.
====

* Application Ingress load balancer: Provides an ingress point for application traffic flowing in from outside the cluster. A working configuration for the Ingress router is required for an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Configure the following conditions:

** Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
** A connection-based or session-based persistence is recommended, based on the options available and types of applications that will be hosted on the platform.

[TIP]
====
If the true IP address of the client can be seen by the application Ingress load balancer, enabling source IP-based session persistence can improve performance for applications that use end-to-end TLS encryption.
====

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the load balancers:

.Application Ingress load balancer

|===

[NOTE]
====
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.

= Example load balancer configuration for user-provisioned clusters

[role="_abstract"]
Reference the example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration so that you can understand how to meet the load balancing requirements for user-provisioned clusters.

The sample is an `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another.

= Example load balancer configuration for clusters that are deployed with user-managed load balancers

This section provides an example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration that meets the load balancing requirements for clusters that are deployed with user-managed load balancers. The sample is an `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another.

[TIP]
====
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer, you can check that the `haproxy` process is listening on ports `6443`, `22623`, `443`, and `80` by running `netstat -nltupe` on the HAProxy node.
====

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer and SELinux is set to `enforcing`, you must ensure that the HAProxy service can bind to the configured TCP port by running `setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any=1`.

[id="installation-obtaining-installer_{context}"]
= Obtaining the installation program

[role="_abstract"]
Before you install OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on
the mirror host, so that installation assets exist for deployment in your environment.
a bastion host on your cloud network or a machine that has access to the to the network through a VPN. This ensures that installation assets exist for deployment in your environment.

For more information about private cluster installation requirements, see "Private clusters".
//mpytlak: Added "private" in the context of a review for the {ibm-cloud-title} private work. In an effort to keep updates to other platforms separate, I will open a doc story for each platform that supports a private install.

.Prerequisites

* You have a machine that runs Linux, for example Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, with 500 MB of local disk space.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you attempt to run the installation program on macOS, a known issue related to the `golang` compiler causes the installation of the OpenShift Container Platform cluster to fail. For more information about this issue, see the section named "Known Issues" in the _OpenShift Container Platform  release notes_ document.
====

.Procedure

. Go to the Cluster Type page on the {hybrid-console}. If you have a Red{nbsp}Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.
+
[TIP]
====
You can also download the binaries for a specific OpenShift Container Platform release.
====

. Select your infrastructure provider from the *Run it yourself* section of the page.

. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under *OpenShift Installer* and click *Download Installer*.

. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

. Download the installation program from https://github.com/openshift/okd/releases.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.

* Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
====

. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
----

. Download your installation {cluster-manager-url-pull}. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for OpenShift Container Platform components.
+
Using a {cluster-manager-url-pull} is not required. You can use a pull secret for another private registry. Or, if you do not need the cluster to pull images from a private registry, you can use `{"auths":{"fake":{"auth":"aWQ6cGFzcwo="}}}` as the pull secret when prompted during the installation.
+
If you do not use the {cluster-manager-url-pull}:
+
* Red{nbsp}Hat Operators are not available.
* The Telemetry and {insights-operator}s do not send data to Red{nbsp}Hat.
* Content from the Red{nbsp}Hat Ecosystem Catalog Container images registry, such as image streams and Operators, are not available.
+
[TIP]
====
Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal, where you can specify a version of the installation program to download.
However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.

[id="installation-initializing_{context}"]
= Creating the installation configuration file

[role="_abstract"]
You can customize the OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on
Amazon Web Services (AWS).
{gcp-first}.
{ibm-cloud-name}.
{rh-openstack-first}.
VMware vSphere.
Nutanix.
{ibm-power-vc-name}.
Microsoft Azure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not specify `windows`, `microsoft`, or other variants of these words in the `metadata.name` parameter of the `install-config.yaml` file. Specifying one of these words for the cluster name causes the installation program to generate an error message like the following example message:

[source,terminal]
----
The resource name 'windows-xxxx-identity' or a part of the name is a trademarked or reserved word.
----

Additionally, specifying `login` at the beginning of the name in the `metadata.name` parameter of the `install-config.yaml` file results in the generation of an error message. You can specify `login` in the middle or end of the name.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.
* You have the `imageContentSources` values that were generated during mirror registry creation.
* You have the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file that was created when you mirrored your registry.
* You have the location of the {op-system-first} image you download.
* You have the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file that was created when you mirrored your registry.
* You have obtained the contents of the certificate for your mirror registry.
* You have retrieved a {op-system-first} image and uploaded it to an accessible location.
* You have an Azure subscription ID and tenant ID.
* If you are installing the cluster using a service principal, you have its application ID and password.
* If you are installing the cluster using a system-assigned managed identity, you have enabled it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
* If you are installing the cluster using a user-assigned managed identity, you have met these prerequisites:
** You have its client ID.
** You have assigned it to the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
* You have verified that you have met the Nutanix networking requirements. For more information, see "Preparing to install on Nutanix".
* Configure a {gcp-short} account.

.Procedure

. Optional: If you have run the installation program on this computer before, and want to use an alternative service principal or managed identity, go to the `~/.azure/` directory and delete the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file.
+
Deleting this file prevents the installation program from automatically reusing subscription and authentication values from a previous installation.

. Create the `install-config.yaml` file.
+
.. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory>
----
* `<installation_directory>`: For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.
+
When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the `execute` permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version.
+
[NOTE]
=====
Always delete the `~/.powervs` directory to avoid reusing a stale configuration. Run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ rm -rf ~/.powervs
----
=====
+
.. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
+
... Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.
====
+

. Modify the `install-config.yaml` file. The AWS Outposts installation has the following limitations which require manual modification of the `install-config.yaml` file:
+
* Unlike AWS Regions, which offer near-infinite scale, AWS Outposts are limited by their provisioned capacity, EC2 family and generations, configured instance sizes, and availability of compute capacity that is not already consumed by other workloads. Therefore, when creating new OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you need to provide the supported instance type in the `compute.platform.aws.type` section in the configuration file.
* When deploying OpenShift Container Platform cluster with remote workers running in AWS Outposts, only one Availability Zone can be used for the compute instances - the Availability Zone in which the Outpost instance was created in. Therefore, when creating new OpenShift Container Platform cluster, it recommended to provide the relevant Availability Zone in the `compute.platform.aws.zones` section in the configuration file, in order to limit the compute instances to this Availability Zone.
* Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) gp3 volumes are not supported by the AWS Outposts service. This volume type is the default type used by the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Therefore, when creating new OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you must change the volume type in the `compute.platform.aws.rootVolume.type` section to gp2.
You will find more information about how to change these values below.

. Modify the `install-config.yaml` file. You can find more information about the available parameters in the "Installation configuration parameters" section.

= Deploying the cluster

[role="_abstract"]
To deploy your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can initialize installation by running the `openshift-install create cluster` command from the directory that contains the installation program. The installation program provisions infrastructure and completes cluster setup.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can run the `create cluster` command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have the OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
+
If the {op-system-first} image is available locally, the host running the installation program does not require internet access.
* You have an Azure subscription ID and tenant ID.
* You have the application ID and password of a service principal.
* If you are installing the cluster using a service principal, you have its application ID and password.
* If you are installing the cluster using a system-assigned managed identity, you have enabled it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
* If you are installing the cluster using a user-assigned managed identity, you have met these prerequisites:
** You have its client ID.
** You have assigned it to the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.
* Optional: Before you create the cluster, you configured an external load balancer in place of the default load balancer.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You do not need to specify API and Ingress static addresses for your installation program. If you choose this configuration, you must take additional actions to define network targets that accept an IP address from each referenced vSphere subnet. See the section "Configuring a user-managed load balancer".
====

.Procedure
. Remove any existing {gcp-short} credentials that do not use the service account key
for the {gcp-short} account that you configured for your cluster and that are stored in the
following locations:
** The `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON`, or `GCLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON`
environment variables
** The `~/.gcp/osServiceAccount.json` file
** The `gcloud cli` default credentials

. Optional: If you have run the installation program on this computer before, and want to use an alternative service principal, go to the `~/.azure/` directory and delete the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file.
+
Deleting this file prevents the installation program from automatically reusing subscription and authentication values from a previous installation.
. Optional: If you have run the installation program on this computer before, and want to use an alternative service principal or managed identity, go to the `~/.azure/` directory and delete the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file.

location of your customized `./install-config.yaml` file.
directory name to store the files that the installation program creates.
** To view different installation details, specify `warn`, `debug`, or
`error` instead of `info`.

+
If the installation program cannot locate the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file from a previous installation, you are prompted for Azure subscription and authentication values.
. Enter the following Azure parameter values for your subscription:
** *azure subscription id*: Enter the subscription ID to use for the cluster.
** *azure tenant id*: Enter the tenant ID.
. Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the *azure service principal client id*:
** If you are using a service principal, enter its application ID.
** If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.
** If you are using a user-assigned managed identity, specify its client ID.
. Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the *azure service principal client secret*:
** If you are using a service principal, enter its password.
** If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.
** If you are using a user-assigned managed identity,leave this value blank.
+
[NOTE]
====
If previously not detected, the installation program creates an `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file and stores this file in the `~/.azure/` directory on your computer. This ensures that the installation program can load the profile when it is creating an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the target platform.
====

+
When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the `execute` permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier OpenShift Container Platform version.

. Provide values at the prompts:

.. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.
====
.. Select *aws* as the platform to target.
.. If you do not have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) profile stored on your computer, enter the AWS access key ID and secret access key for the user that you configured to run the
installation program.
+
[NOTE]
====
The AWS access key ID and secret access key are stored in `~/.aws/credentials` in the home directory of the current user on the installation host. You are prompted for the credentials by the installation program if the credentials for the exported profile are not present in the file. Any credentials that you provide to the installation program are stored in the file.
====
.. Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
.. Select the base domain for the Route 53 service that you configured for your cluster.
.. Select *azure* as the platform to target.
+
If the installation program cannot locate the `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file from a previous installation, you are prompted for Azure subscription and authentication values.
.. Specify the following Azure parameter values for your subscription and service principal:
*** *azure subscription id*: Enter the subscription ID to use for the cluster.
*** *azure tenant id*: Enter the tenant ID.
*** *azure service principal client id*: Enter its application ID.
*** *azure service principal client secret*: Enter its password.
.. Select the region to deploy the cluster to.
.. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds to the Azure DNS Zone that you created for your cluster.
.. Select *gcp* as the platform to target.
.. If you have not configured the service account key for your {gcp-short} account on
your host, you must obtain it from {gcp-short} and paste the contents of the file
or enter the absolute path to the file.
.. Select the project ID to provision the cluster in. The default value is
specified by the service account that you configured.
.. Select the region to deploy the cluster to.
.. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds
to the public DNS zone that you created for your cluster.
.. test
.. Select *openstack* as the platform to target.
.. Specify the {rh-openstack-first} external network name to use for installing the cluster.
.. Specify the Floating IP address to use for external access to the OpenShift API.
.. Specify the {rh-openstack} flavor with at least 16 GB RAM to use for control plane
and compute nodes.
.. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. All DNS records will be
sub-domains of this base and will also include the cluster name.
.. Select *vsphere* as the platform to target.
.. Specify the name of your vCenter instance.
.. Specify the user name and password for the vCenter account that has the required permissions to create the cluster.
+
The installation program connects to your vCenter instance.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Some VMware vCenter Single Sign-On (SSO) environments with Active Directory (AD) integration might primarily require you to use the traditional login method, which requires the `<domain>\` construct.

To ensure that vCenter account permission checks complete properly, consider using the User Principal Name (UPN) login method, such as `<username>@<fully_qualified_domainname>`.
====

.. Select the data center in your vCenter instance to connect to.
.. Select the default vCenter datastore to use.
+
[NOTE]
====
Datastore and cluster names cannot exceed 60 characters; therefore, ensure the combined string length does not exceed the 60 character limit.
====
.. Select the vCenter cluster to install the OpenShift Container Platform cluster in. The installation program uses the root resource pool of the vSphere cluster as the default resource pool.
.. Select the network in the vCenter instance that contains the virtual IP addresses and DNS records that you configured.
.. Enter the virtual IP address that you configured for control plane API access.
.. Enter the virtual IP address that you configured for cluster ingress.
.. Enter the base domain. This base domain must be the same one that you used in the DNS records that you configured.
.. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
The cluster name must be the same one that you used in the DNS records that you configured.
+
[NOTE]
====
Datastore and cluster names cannot exceed 60 characters; therefore, ensure the combined string length does not exceed the 60 character limit.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see
Resolve reserved resource name errors in the Azure documentation.
====
If you provide a name that is longer
than 6 characters, only the first 6 characters will be used in the infrastructure
ID that is generated from the cluster name.
.. Paste the {cluster-manager-url-pull}.
.. Paste the {cluster-manager-url-pull}.
* If you do not have a {cluster-manager-url-pull}, you can paste the pull secret another private registry.
* If you do not need the cluster to pull images from a private registry, you can paste `{"auths":{"fake":{"auth":"aWQ6cGFzcwo="}}}` as the pull secret.

+
[NOTE]
====
If previously not detected, the installation program creates an `osServicePrincipal.json` configuration file and stores this file in the `~/.azure/` directory on your computer. This ensures that the installation program can load the profile when it is creating an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the target platform.
====

. Optional: Remove or disable the `AdministratorAccess` policy from the IAM
account that you used to install the cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The elevated permissions provided by the `AdministratorAccess` policy are required only during installation.
====

. Optional: You can reduce the number of permissions for the service account that you used to install the cluster.
** If you assigned the `Owner` role to your service account, you can remove that role and replace it with the `Viewer` role.
** If you included the `Service Account Key Admin` role,
you can remove it.

.Verification

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the `kubeadmin` user.

* Credential information also outputs to `<installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
====
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for _Recovering from expired control plane certificates_ for more information.

* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

[id="cli-logging-in-kubeadmin_{context}"]
= Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
To log in to your cluster as the default system user, export the `kubeconfig` file. This configuration enables the CLI to authenticate and connect to the specific API server created during OpenShift Container Platform installation.

The `kubeconfig` file is specific to a cluster and is created during OpenShift Container Platform installation.

.Prerequisites
* You deployed an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the {oc-first}.
* Ensure the bootstrap process completed successfully.

.Procedure

. Export the `kubeadmin` credentials by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
----
+
where:
+
`<installation_directory>`:: Specifies the path to the directory that stores the installation files.

. Verify you can run `oc` commands successfully using the exported configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc whoami
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
system:admin

[id="cluster-telemetry_{context}"]
= Telemetry access for OpenShift Container Platform

[role="_abstract"]
To provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, the Telemetry service requires internet access. When connected, this service runs automatically by default and registers your cluster to {cluster-manager-url}.

After you confirm that your {cluster-manager-url} inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using {cluster-manager},use subscription watch to track your OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level. For more information about subscription watch, see "Data Gathered and Used by Red Hat's subscription services" in the _Additional resources_ section.
